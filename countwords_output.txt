that 11
a 6799
single 15
man 342
in 2719
possession 3
of 109
a 6799

known 1

views 1
of 109
such 2
a 6799
man 342
may 49
be 1200
on 86
his 43
first 8
entering 1
a 6799
this 6
truth 7
is 124
so 797
well 24
fixed 2
in 2719
the 193
minds 4
of 109
the 193
surrounding 4
families 1
that 11
he 962
is 124
considered 1
the 193
rightful 4
property 2
of 109
some 30
one 19
or 333
other 5
of 109
their 2
daughters 1
my 90
dear 15
mr 5
bennet 1
said 1
his 43
lady 18
to 805
him 9
one 19
day 27
have 11
you 29
heard 1
that 11
park 18
is 124
let 50
at 272
last 7
mr 5
bennet 1
replied 1
that 11
he 962
had 11
not 85
but 82
it 67
is 124
returned 1
she 199
for 484
mrs 1
long 49
has 41
just 24
been 1
here 31
and 51
she 199
told 1
me 1041
all 162
about 1
it 67
mr 5
bennet 1
made 13
no 896
answer 8
do 814
you 29
not 85
want 13
to 805
know 12
who 79
has 41
taken 1
it 67
cried 1
his 43
wife 6
impatiently 1
you 29
want 13
to 805
tell 16
me 1041
and 51
i 4330
have 11
no 896
objection 5
to 805
hearing 3
it 67
this 6
was 93
invitation 6
enough 2
why 4
my 90
dear 15
you 29
must 28
know 12
mrs 1
long 49
says 1
that 11
is 124
taken 1
by 57
a 6799
young 9
man 342
of 109
large 11
fortune 8
from 2
the 193
north 42
of 109
england 2
that 11
he 962
came 36
down 90
on 86
monday 3
in 2719
a 6799
chaise 3
and 51
four 26
to 805
see 70
the 193
place 29
and 51
was 93
so 797
much 2
delighted 2
with 34
it 67
that 11
he 962
agreed 1
with 34
mr 5
morris 2
immediately 1
that 11
he 962
is 124
to 805
take 18
possession 3
before 2
michaelmas 3
and 51
some 30
of 109
his 43
servants 1
are 12
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
the 193
house 87
by 57
the 193
end 92
of 109
next 2
week 20
what 14
is 124
his 43
name 17
is 124
he 962
married 3
or 333
single 15
oh 17
single 15
my 90
dear 15
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
a 6799
single 15
man 342
of 109
large 11
fortune 8
four 26
or 333
five 5
thousand 7
a 6799
year 19
what 14
a 6799
fine 17
thing 15
for 484
our 3
girls 1
how 27
so 797
how 27
can 287
it 67
affect 15
them 9
my 90
dear 15
mr 5
bennet 1
replied 1
his 43
wife 6
how 27
can 287
you 29
be 1200
so 797
tiresome 4
you 29
must 28
know 12
that 11
i 4330
am 392
thinking 2
of 109
his 43
marrying 1
one 19
of 109
them 9
is 124
that 11
his 43
design 16
in 2719
settling 1
here 31
design 16
nonsense 2
how 27
can 287
you 29
talk 18
so 797
but 82
it 67
is 124
very 1
likely 1
that 11
he 962
may 49
fall 29
in 2719
love 29
with 34
one 19
of 109
them 9
and 51
therefore 1
you 29
must 28
visit 14
him 9
as 509
soon 3
as 509
he 962
comes 4
i 4330
see 70
no 896
occasion 7
for 484
that 11
you 29
and 51
the 193
girls 1
may 49
go 500
or 333
you 29
may 49
send 10
them 9
by 57
themselves 1
which 2
perhaps 1
will 39
be 1200
still 13
better 7
for 484
as 509
you 29
are 12
as 509
handsome 6
as 509
any 17
of 109
them 9
mr 5
may 49
like 22
you 29
the 193
best 37
of 109
the 193
party 3
my 90
dear 15
you 29
flatter 10
me 1041
i 4330
certainly 1
have 11
had 11
my 90
share 22
of 109
beauty 2
but 82
i 4330
do 814
not 85
pretend 7
to 805
be 1200
anything 3
extraordinary 1
now 10
when 6
a 6799
woman 21
has 41
five 5
grown 4
up 194
daughters 1
she 199
ought 2
to 805
give 15
over 596
thinking 2
of 109
her 181
own 9
beauty 2
in 2719
such 2
cases 1
a 6799
woman 21
has 41
not 85
often 4
much 2
beauty 2
to 805
think 8
of 109
but 82
my 90
dear 15
you 29
must 28
indeed 1
go 500
and 51
see 70
mr 5
when 6
he 962
comes 4
into 26
the 193
it 67
is 124
more 11
than 22
i 4330
engage 6
for 484
i 4330
assure 6
you 29
but 82
consider 13
your 4
daughters 1
only 1
think 8
what 14
an 970
establishment 3
it 67
would 5
be 1200
for 484
one 19
of 109
them 9
sir 22
william 3
and 51
lady 18
lucas 1
are 12
determined 2
to 805
go 500
merely 1
on 86
that 11
account 14
for 484
in 2719
general 22
you 29
know 12
they 5
visit 14
no 896
newcomers 1
indeed 1
you 29
must 28
go 500
for 484
it 67
will 39
be 1200
impossible 2
for 484
us 70
to 805
visit 14
him 9
if 8
you 29
do 814
not 85
you 29
are 12
over 596
scrupulous 4
surely 1
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
mr 5
will 39
be 1200
very 1
glad 30
to 805
see 70
you 29
and 51
i 4330
will 39
send 10
a 6799
few 6
lines 4
by 57
you 29
to 805
assure 6
him 9
of 109
my 90
hearty 2
consent 5
to 805
his 43
marrying 1
whichever 1
he 962
chooses 1
of 109
the 193
girls 1
though 12
i 4330
must 28
throw 14
in 2719
a 6799
good 28
word 26
for 484
my 90
little 6
lizzy 2
i 4330
desire 6
you 29
will 39
do 814
no 896
such 2
thing 15
lizzy 2
is 124
not 85
a 6799
bit 48
better 7
than 22
the 193
others 1
and 51
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
she 199
is 124
not 85
half 23
so 797
handsome 6
as 509
jane 8
nor 102
half 23
so 797
good 28
as 509
lydia 4
but 82
you 29
are 12
always 1
giving 2
her 181
the 193
preference 3
they 5
have 11
none 32
of 109
them 9
much 2
to 805
recommend 8
them 9
replied 1
he 962
they 5
are 12
all 162
silly 2
and 51
ignorant 2
like 22
other 5
girls 1
but 82
lizzy 2
has 41
something 3
more 11
of 109
quickness 2
than 22
her 181
sisters 1
mr 5
bennet 1
how 27
can 287
you 29
abuse 7
your 4
own 9
children 1
in 2719
such 2
a 6799
way 27
you 29
take 18
delight 8
in 2719
vexing 1
me 1041
you 29
have 11
no 896
compassion 4
for 484
my 90
poor 11
nerves 1
you 29
mistake 5
me 1041
my 90
dear 15
i 4330
have 11
a 6799
high 54
respect 18
for 484
your 4
nerves 1
they 5
are 12
my 90
old 21
friends 4
i 4330
have 11
heard 1
you 29
mention 5
them 9
with 34
consideration 3
these 4
last 7
twenty 2
years 1
at 272
least 3
ah 17
you 29
do 814
not 85
know 12
what 14
i 4330
suffer 11
but 82
i 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 39
get 13
over 596
it 67
and 51
live 43
to 805
see 70
many 2
young 9
men 140
of 109
four 26
thousand 7
a 6799
year 19
come 36
into 26
the 193
it 67
will 39
be 1200
no 896
use 18
to 805
us 70
if 8
twenty 2
such 2
should 7
come 36
since 7
you 29
will 39
not 85
visit 14
them 9
depend 17
upon 1
it 67
my 90
dear 15
that 11
when 6
there 21
are 12
twenty 2
i 4330
will 39
visit 14
them 9
all 162
mr 5
bennet 1
was 93
so 797
odd 17
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109
quick 25
parts 1
sarcastic 2
reserve 7
and 51
caprice 3
that 11
the 193
experience 4
of 109
three 12
and 51
twenty 2
years 1
had 11
been 1
insufficient 2
to 805
make 17
his 43
wife 6
understand 8
his 43
character 16
her 181
mind 25
was 93
less 19
difficult 5
to 805
develop 12
she 199
was 93
a 6799
woman 21
of 109
mean 36
understanding 4
little 6
information 3
and 51
uncertain 5
temper 22
when 6
she 199
was 93
discontented 2
she 199
fancied 1
herself 1
nervous 4
the 193
business 13
of 109
her 181
life 44
was 93
to 805
get 13
her 181
daughters 1
married 3
its 2
solace 4
was 93
visiting 1
and 51
news 71
chapter 3
mr 5
bennet 1
was 93
among 1
the 193
earliest 1
of 109
those 1
who 79
waited 1
on 86
mr 5
he 962
had 11
always 1
intended 3
to 805
visit 14
him 9
though 12
to 805
the 193
last 7
always 1
assuring 1
his 43
wife 6
that 11
he 962
should 7
not 85
go 500
and 51
till 14
the 193
evening 3
after 48
the 193
visit 14
was 93
paid 1
she 199
had 11
no 896
knowledge 4
of 109
it 67
it 67
was 93
then 5
disclosed 1
in 2719
the 193
following 3
manner 8
observing 1
his 43
second 16
daughter 4
employed 1
in 2719
trimming 4
a 6799
hat 64
he 962
suddenly 1
addressed 1
her 181
with 34
i 4330
hope 16
mr 5
will 39
like 22
it 67
lizzy 2
we 444
are 12
not 85
in 2719
a 6799
way 27
to 805
know 12
what 14
mr 5
likes 2
said 1
her 181
mother 21
resentfully 1
since 7
we 444
are 12
not 85
to 805
visit 14
but 82
you 29
forget 8
mamma 9
said 1
elizabeth 5
that 11
we 444
shall 12
meet 9
him 9
at 272
the 193
assemblies 1
and 51
that 11
mrs 1
long 49
promised 1
to 805
introduce 3
him 9
i 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
mrs 1
long 49
will 39
do 814
any 17
such 2
thing 15
she 199
has 41
two 14
nieces 1
of 109
her 181
own 9
she 199
is 124
a 6799
selfish 4
hypocritical 2
woman 21
and 51
i 4330
have 11
no 896
opinion 4
of 109
her 181
no 896
more 11
have 11
i 4330
said 1
mr 5
bennet 1
and 51
i 4330
am 392
glad 30
to 805
find 10
that 11
you 29
do 814
not 85
depend 17
on 86
her 181
serving 3
you 29
mrs 1
bennet 1
deigned 1
not 85
to 805
make 17
any 17
reply 3
but 82
unable 1
to 805
contain 16
herself 1
began 1
scolding 3
one 19
of 109
her 181
daughters 1
don't 1
keep 11
coughing 1
so 797
kitty 2
for 484
heaven's 1
sake 2
have 11
a 6799
little 6
compassion 4
on 86
my 90
nerves 1
you 29
tear 26
them 9
to 805
pieces 1
kitty 2
has 41
no 896
discretion 3
in 2719
her 181
coughs 1
said 1
her 181
father 12
she 199
times 10
them 9
ill 84
i 4330
do 814
not 85
cough 5
for 484
my 90
own 9
amusement 3
replied 1
kitty 2
fretfully 1
when 6
is 124
your 4
next 2
ball 77
to 805
be 1200
lizzy 2
to 805
morrow 3
fortnight 4
aye 4
so 797
it 67
is 124
cried 1
her 181
mother 21
and 51
mrs 1
long 49
does 5
not 85
come 36
back 182
till 14
the 193
day 27
before 2
so 797
it 67
will 39
be 1200
impossible 2
for 484
her 181
to 805
introduce 3
him 9
for 484
she 199
will 39
not 85
know 12
him 9
herself 1
then 5
my 90
dear 15
you 29
may 49
have 11
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
your 4
friend 14
and 51
introduce 3
mr 5
to 805
her 181
impossible 2
mr 5
bennet 1
impossible 2
when 6
i 4330
am 392
not 85
acquainted 1
with 34
him 9
myself 1
how 27
can 287
you 29
be 1200
so 797
teasing 2
i 4330
your 4
circumspection 2
a 6799
fortnight's 1
acquaintance 5
is 124
certainly 1
very 1
little 6
one 19
cannot 1
know 12
what 14
a 6799
man 342
really 1
is 124
by 57
the 193
end 92
of 109
a 6799
fortnight 4
but 82
if 8
we 444
do 814
not 85
venture 8
somebody 2
else 2
will 39
and 51
after 48
all 162
mrs 1
long 49
and 51
her 181
nieces 1
must 28
stand 42
their 2
chance 20
and 51
therefore 1
as 509
she 199
will 39
think 8
it 67
an 970
act 69
of 109
kindness 3
if 8
you 29
decline 7
the 193
office 11
i 4330
will 39
take 18
it 67
on 86
myself 1
the 193
girls 1
stared 1
at 272
their 2
father 12
mrs 1
bennet 1
said 1
only 1
nonsense 2
nonsense 2
what 14
can 287
be 1200
the 193
meaning 11
of 109
that 11
emphatic 2
exclamation 3
cried 1
he 962
do 814
you 29
consider 13
the 193
forms 1
of 109
introduction 3
and 51
the 193
stress 6
that 11
is 124
laid 1
on 86
them 9
as 509
nonsense 2
i 4330
cannot 1
quite 1
agree 11
with 34
you 29
there 21
what 14
say 7
you 29
mary 13
for 484
you 29
are 12
a 6799
young 9
lady 18
of 109
deep 12
reflection 3
i 4330
know 12
and 51
read 49
great 12
books 15
and 51
make 17
extracts 1
mary 13
wished 1
to 805
say 7
something 3
sensible 3
but 82
knew 1
not 85
how 27
while 4
mary 13
is 124
adjusting 1
her 181
ideas 1
he 962
continued 1
let 50
us 70
return 14
to 805
mr 5
i 4330
am 392
sick 38
of 109
mr 5
cried 1
his 43
wife 6
i 4330
am 392
sorry 1
to 805
hear 76
that 11
but 82
why 4
did 23
not 85
you 29
tell 16
me 1041
that 11
before 2
if 8
i 4330
had 11
known 1
as 509
much 2
this 6
morning 3
i 4330
certainly 1
would 5
not 85
have 11
called 1
on 86
him 9
it 67
is 124
very 1
unlucky 1
but 82
as 509
i 4330
have 11
actually 1
paid 1
the 193
visit 14
we 444
cannot 1
escape 10
the 193
acquaintance 5
now 10
the 193
astonishment 2
of 109
the 193
ladies 1
was 93
just 24
what 14
he 962
wished 1
that 11
of 109
mrs 1
bennet 1
perhaps 1
surpassing 1
the 193
rest 110
though 12
when 6
the 193
first 8
tumult 5
of 109
joy 36
was 93
over 596
she 199
began 1
to 805
declare 6
that 11
it 67
was 93
what 14
she 199
had 11
expected 1
all 162
the 193
while 4
how 27
good 28
it 67
was 93
in 2719
you 29
my 90
dear 15
mr 5
bennet 1
but 82
i 4330
knew 1
i 4330
should 7
persuade 6
you 29
at 272
last 7
i 4330
was 93
sure 11
you 29
loved 1
your 4
girls 1
too 50
well 24
to 805
neglect 9
such 2
an 970
acquaintance 5
well 24
how 27
pleased 1
i 4330
am 392
and 51
it 67
is 124
such 2
a 6799
good 28
joke 8
too 50
that 11
you 29
should 7
have 11
gone 4
this 6
morning 3
and 51
never 3
said 1
a 6799
word 26
about 1
it 67
till 14
now 10
now 10
kitty 2
you 29
may 49
cough 5
as 509
much 2
as 509
you 29
choose 5
said 1
mr 5
bennet 1
and 51
as 509
he 962
spoke 14
he 962
left 19
the 193
room 22
fatigued 1
with 34
the 193
raptures 1
of 109
his 43
wife 6
what 14
an 970
excellent 2
father 12
you 29
have 11
girls 1
said 1
she 199
when 6
the 193
door 41
was 93
shut 32
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
how 27
you 29
will 39
ever 33
make 17
him 9
amends 1
for 484
his 43
kindness 3
or 333
me 1041
either 1
for 484
that 11
matter 7
at 272
our 3
time 45
of 109
life 44
it 67
is 124
not 85
so 797
pleasant 9
i 4330
can 287
tell 16
you 29
to 805
be 1200
making 4
new 115
acquaintances 3
every 10
day 27
but 82
for 484
your 4
we 444
would 5
do 814
anything 3
lydia 4
my 90
love 29
though 12
you 29
are 12
the 193
youngest 1
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
mr 5
will 39
dance 7
with 34
you 29
at 272
the 193
next 2
ball 77
oh 17
said 1
lydia 4
stoutly 1
i 4330
am 392
not 85
afraid 1
for 484
though 12
i 4330
am 392
the 193
youngest 1
i'm 1
the 193
tallest 1
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
evening 3
was 93
spent 1
in 2719
conjecturing 1
how 27
soon 3
he 962
would 5
return 14
mr 5
visit 14
and 51
determining 1
when 6
they 5
should 7
ask 6
him 9
to 805
dinner 9
chapter 3
not 85
all 162
that 11
mrs 1
bennet 1
however 1
with 34
the 193
assistance 2
of 109
her 181
five 5
daughters 1
could 2
ask 6
on 86
the 193
subject 11
was 93
sufficient 2
to 805
draw 24
from 2
her 181
husband 10
any 17
satisfactory 1
description 3
of 109
mr 5
they 5
attacked 1
him 9
in 2719
various 2
ways 4
with 34
barefaced 2
questions 1
ingenious 4
suppositions 1
and 51
distant 2
surmises 1
but 82
he 962
eluded 1
the 193
skill 11
of 109
them 9
all 162
and 51
they 5
were 5
at 272
last 7
obliged 1
to 805
accept 16
the 193
second 16
hand 137
intelligence 2
of 109
their 2
lady 18
lucas 1
her 181
report 12
was 93
highly 1
sir 22
william 3
had 11
been 1
delighted 2
with 34
him 9
he 962
was 93
quite 1
young 9
wonderfully 1
handsome 6
extremely 1
agreeable 3
and 51
to 805
crown 5
the 193
whole 26
he 962
meant 3
to 805
be 1200
at 272
the 193
next 2
assembly 8
with 34
a 6799
large 11
party 3
nothing 5
could 2
be 1200
more 11
delightful 2
to 805
be 1200
fond 17
of 109
dancing 2
was 93
a 6799
certain 5
step 48
towards 1
falling 1
in 2719
love 29
and 51
very 1
lively 1
hopes 1
of 109
mr 5
heart 57
were 5
entertained 1
if 8
i 4330
can 287
but 82
see 70
one 19
of 109
my 90
daughters 1
happily 1
settled 1
at 272
said 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
to 805
her 181
husband 10
and 51
all 162
the 193
others 1
equally 1
well 24
married 3
i 4330
shall 12
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
wish 13
for 484
in 2719
a 6799
few 6
days 1
mr 5
returned 1
mr 5
visit 14
and 51
sat 92
about 1
ten 151
minutes 2
with 34
him 9
in 2719
his 43
library 2
he 962
had 11
entertained 1
hopes 1
of 109
being 3
admitted 2
to 805
a 6799
sight 17
of 109
the 193
young 9
ladies 1
of 109
whose 1
beauty 2
he 962
had 11
heard 1
much 2
but 82
he 962
saw 24
only 1
the 193
father 12
the 193
ladies 1
were 5
somewhat 2
more 11
fortunate 2
for 484
they 5
had 11
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
ascertaining 1
from 2
an 970
upper 15
window 12
that 11
he 962
wore 1
a 6799
blue 61
coat 12
and 51
rode 9
a 6799
black 92
horse 52
an 970
invitation 6
to 805
dinner 9
was 93
soon 3
afterwards 1
dispatched 1
and 51
already 1
had 11
mrs 1
bennet 1
planned 1
the 193
courses 1
that 11
were 5
to 805
do 814
credit 12
to 805
her 181
housekeeping 2
when 6
an 970
answer 8
arrived 1
which 2
deferred 1
it 67
all 162
mr 5
was 93
obliged 1
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
town 27
the 193
following 3
day 27
and 51
consequently 1
unable 1
to 805
accept 16
the 193
of 109
their 2
invitation 6
etc 10
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
quite 1
disconcerted 1
she 199
could 2
not 85
imagine 3
what 14
business 13
he 962
could 2
have 11
in 2719
town 27
so 797
soon 3
after 48
his 43
arrival 3
in 2719
and 51
she 199
began 1
to 805
fear 14
that 11
he 962
might 9
be 1200
always 1
flying 2
about 1
from 2
one 19
place 29
to 805
another 1
and 51
never 3
settled 1
at 272
as 509
he 962
ought 2
to 805
be 1200
lady 18
lucas 1
quieted 1
her 181
fears 2
a 6799
little 6
by 57
starting 1
the 193
idea 21
of 109
his 43
being 3
gone 4
to 805
london 5
only 1
to 805
get 13
a 6799
large 11
party 3
for 484
the 193
ball 77
and 51
a 6799
report 12
soon 3
followed 1
that 11
mr 5
was 93
to 805
bring 6
twelve 6
ladies 1
and 51
seven 18
gentlemen 1
with 34
him 9
to 805
the 193
assembly 8
the 193
girls 1
grieved 1
over 596
such 2
a 6799
number 8
of 109
ladies 1
but 82
were 5
comforted 1
the 193
day 27
before 2
the 193
ball 77
by 57
hearing 3
that 11
instead 1
of 109
twelve 6
he 962
brought 1
only 1
six 24
with 34
him 9
from 2
london 5
his 43
five 5
sisters 1
and 51
a 6799
cousin 3
and 51
when 6
the 193
party 3
entered 1
the 193
assembly 8
room 22
it 67
consisted 1
of 109
only 1
five 5
altogether 1
mr 5
his 43
two 14
sisters 1
the 193
husband 10
of 109
the 193
eldest 1
and 51
another 1
young 9
man 342
mr 5
was 93
good 28
looking 1
and 51
he 962
had 11
a 6799
pleasant 9
countenance 4
and 51
easy 2
unaffected 2
manners 1
his 43
sisters 1
were 5
fine 17
women 5
with 34
an 970
air 129
of 109
decided 2
fashion 10
his 43
brother 9
in 2719
law 45
mr 5
hurst 2
merely 1
looked 1
the 193
gentleman 3
but 82
his 43
friend 14
mr 5
darcy 2
soon 3
drew 2
the 193
attention 3
of 109
the 193
room 22
by 57
his 43
fine 17
tall 35
person 33
handsome 6
features 1
noble 13
mien 3
and 51
the 193
report 12
which 2
was 93
in 2719
general 22
circulation 3
within 3
five 5
minutes 2
after 48
his 43
entrance 6
of 109
his 43
having 1
ten 151
thousand 7
a 6799
year 19
the 193
gentlemen 1
pronounced 1
him 9
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
fine 17
figure 7
of 109
a 6799
man 342
the 193
ladies 1
declared 1
he 962
was 93
much 2
handsomer 1
than 22
mr 5
and 51
he 962
was 93
looked 1
at 272
with 34
great 12
admiration 2
for 484
about 1
half 23
the 193
evening 3
till 14
his 43
manners 1
gave 4
a 6799
disgust 7
which 2
turned 1
the 193
tide 15
of 109
his 43
popularity 2
for 484
he 962
was 93
discovered 1
to 805
be 1200
proud 5
to 805
be 1200
above 3
his 43
company 2
and 51
above 3
being 3
pleased 1
and 51
not 85
all 162
his 43
large 11
estate 3
in 2719
could 2
then 5
save 7
him 9
from 2
having 1
a 6799
most 3
forbidding 3
disagreeable 3
countenance 4
and 51
being 3
unworthy 1
to 805
be 1200
compared 1
with 34
his 43
friend 14
mr 5
had 11
soon 3
made 13
himself 1
acquainted 1
with 34
all 162
the 193
principal 7
people 4
in 2719
the 193
room 22
he 962
was 93
lively 1
and 51
unreserved 2
danced 1
every 10
dance 7
was 93
angry 1
that 11
the 193
ball 77
closed 1
so 797
early 1
and 51
talked 1
of 109
giving 2
one 19
himself 1
at 272
such 2
amiable 1
qualities 1
must 28
speak 12
for 484
themselves 1
what 14
a 6799
contrast 5
between 1
him 9
and 51
his 43
friend 14
mr 5
darcy 2
danced 1
only 1
once 2
with 34
mrs 1
hurst 2
and 51
once 2
with 34
miss 71
declined 1
being 3
introduced 1
to 805
any 17
other 5
lady 18
and 51
spent 1
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
evening 3
in 2719
walking 2
about 1
the 193
room 22
speaking 2
occasionally 1
to 805
one 19
of 109
his 43
own 9
party 3
his 43
character 16
was 93
decided 2
he 962
was 93
the 193
proudest 1
most 3
disagreeable 3
man 342
in 2719
the 193
world 12
and 51
everybody 2
hoped 1
that 11
he 962
would 5
never 3
come 36
there 21
again 2
the 193
most 3
violent 2
against 1
him 9
was 93
mrs 1
bennet 1
whose 1
dislike 4
of 109
his 43
general 22
was 93
sharpened 1
into 26
particular 13
resentment 3
by 57
his 43
having 1
slighted 1
one 19
of 109
her 181
daughters 1
elizabeth 5
bennet 1
had 11
been 1
obliged 1
by 57
the 193
scarcity 2
of 109
gentlemen 1
to 805
sit 29
down 90
for 484
two 14
dances 1
and 51
during 1
part 102
of 109
that 11
time 45
mr 5
darcy 2
had 11
been 1
standing 3
near 15
enough 2
for 484
her 181
to 805
hear 76
a 6799
conversation 8
between 1
him 9
and 51
mr 5
who 79
came 36
from 2
the 193
dance 7
for 484
a 6799
few 6
minutes 2
to 805
press 30
his 43
friend 14
to 805
join 16
it 67
come 36
darcy 2
said 1
he 962
i 4330
must 28
have 11
you 29
dance 7
i 4330
hate 14
to 805
see 70
you 29
standing 3
about 1
by 57
yourself 1
in 2719
this 6
stupid 9
manner 8
you 29
had 11
much 2
better 7
dance 7
i 4330
certainly 1
shall 12
not 85
you 29
know 12
how 27
i 4330
detest 8
it 67
unless 1
i 4330
am 392
particularly 1
acquainted 1
with 34
my 90
partner 8
at 272
such 2
an 970
assembly 8
as 509
this 6
it 67
would 5
be 1200
insupportable 1
your 4
sisters 1
are 12
engaged 1
and 51
there 21
is 124
not 85
another 1
woman 21
in 2719
the 193
room 22
whom 3
it 67
would 5
not 85
be 1200
a 6799
punishment 3
to 805
me 1041
to 805
stand 42
up 194
with 34
i 4330
would 5
not 85
be 1200
so 797
fastidious 4
as 509
you 29
are 12
cried 1
mr 5
for 484
a 6799
kingdom 3
upon 1
my 90
i 4330
never 3
met 180
with 34
so 797
many 2
pleasant 9
girls 1
in 2719
my 90
life 44
as 509
i 4330
have 11
this 6
evening 3
and 51
there 21
are 12
several 3
of 109
them 9
you 29
see 70
uncommonly 1
pretty 3
you 29
are 12
dancing 2
with 34
the 193
only 1
handsome 6
girl 14
in 2719
the 193
room 22

mr 5
darcy 2
looking 1
at 272
the 193
eldest 1
miss 71
bennet 1
oh 17

the 193
most 3
beautiful 2
creature 3

but 82
there 21
is 124
one 19
of 109
her 181
sisters 1
sitting 3
down 90
just 24
behind 4
you 29
who 79
is 124
very 1
pretty 3
and 51
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
very 1
agreeable 3

let 50
me 1041
ask 6
my 90
partner 8
to 805
introduce 3
you 29
which 2
do 814
you 29
mean 36
and 51
turning 3
round 29
he 962
looked 1
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
at 272
elizabeth 5
till 14
catching 2
her 181
eye 57
he 962
withdrew 1
his 43
own 9
and 51
coldly 1
said 1
she 199
is 124
tolerable 1
but 82
not 85
handsome 6
enough 2
to 805
tempt 14
me 1041
i 4330
am 392
in 2719
no 896
at 272
present 20
to 805
give 15
consequence 3
to 805
young 9
ladies 1
who 79
are 12
slighted 1
by 57
other 5
men 140
you 29
had 11
better 7
return 14
to 805
your 4
partner 8
and 51
enjoy 9
her 181
smiles 1
for 484
you 29
are 12
wasting 1
your 4
time 45
with 34
me 1041
mr 5
followed 1
his 43
advice 2
mr 5
darcy 2
walked 1
off 100
and 51
elizabeth 5
remained 1
with 34
no 896
very 1
cordial 6
feelings 1
toward 2
him 9
she 199
told 1
the 193
story 13
however 1
with 34
great 12
spirit 20
among 1
her 181
friends 4
for 484
she 199
had 11
a 6799
lively 1
playful 4
disposition 3
which 2
delighted 2
in 2719
anything 3
ridiculous 4
the 193
evening 3
altogether 1
passed 1
off 100
pleasantly 1
to 805
the 193
whole 26
family 2
mrs 1
bennet 1
had 11
seen 1
her 181
eldest 1
daughter 4
much 2
admired 1
by 57
the 193
party 3
mr 5
had 11
danced 1
with 34
her 181
twice 1
and 51
she 199
had 11
been 1
distinguished 1
by 57
his 43
sisters 1
jane 8
was 93
as 509
much 2
gratified 1
by 57
this 6
as 509
her 181
mother 21
could 2
be 1200
though 12
in 2719
a 6799
quieter 1
way 27
elizabeth 5
felt 5
pleasure 5
mary 13
had 11
heard 1
herself 1
mentioned 1
to 805
miss 71
as 509
the 193
most 3
accomplished 1
girl 14
in 2719
the 193
and 51
catherine 2
and 51
lydia 4
had 11
been 1
fortunate 2
enough 2
never 3
to 805
be 1200
without 1
partners 4
which 2
was 93
all 162
that 11
they 5
had 11
yet 4
to 805
care 47
for 484
at 272
a 6799
ball 77
they 5
returned 1
therefore 1
in 2719
good 28
spirits 1
to 805
the 193
village 6
where 21
they 5
lived 1
and 51
of 109
which 2
they 5
were 5
the 193
principal 7
inhabitants 1
they 5
found 18
mr 5
bennet 1
still 13
up 194
with 34
a 6799
book 69
he 962
was 93
regardless 1
of 109
time 45
and 51
on 86
the 193
present 20
occasion 7
he 962
had 11
a 6799
good 28
deal 13
of 109
curiosity 2
as 509
to 805
the 193
event 18
of 109
an 970
evening 3
which 2
had 11
raised 1
such 2
splendid 4
expectations 1
he 962
had 11
rather 2
hoped 1
that 11
his 43
wife's 1
views 1
on 86
the 193
stranger 3
would 5
be 1200
disappointed 1
but 82
he 962
soon 3
found 18
out 365
that 11
he 962
had 11
a 6799
different 11
story 13
to 805
hear 76
oh 17
my 90
dear 15
mr 5
bennet 1
as 509
she 199
entered 1
the 193
room 22
we 444
have 11
had 11
a 6799
most 3
delightful 2
evening 3
a 6799
most 3
excellent 2
ball 77
i 4330
wish 13
you 29
had 11
been 1
there 21
jane 8
was 93
so 797
admired 1
nothing 5
could 2
be 1200
like 22
it 67
everybody 2
said 1
how 27
well 24
she 199
looked 1
and 51
mr 5
thought 11
her 181
quite 1
beautiful 2
and 51
danced 1
with 34
her 181
twice 1
only 1
think 8
of 109
that 11
my 90
dear 15
he 962
actually 1
danced 1
with 34
her 181
twice 1
and 51
she 199
was 93
the 193
only 1
creature 3
in 2719
the 193
room 22
that 11
he 962
asked 1
a 6799
second 16
time 45
first 8
of 109
all 162
he 962
asked 1
miss 71
lucas 1
i 4330
was 93
so 797
vexed 1
to 805
see 70
him 9
stand 42
up 194
with 34
her 181
but 82
however 1
he 962
did 23
not 85
admire 6
her 181
at 272
all 162
indeed 1
nobody 2
can 287
you 29
know 12
and 51
he 962
seemed 1
quite 1
struck 1
with 34
jane 8
as 509
she 199
was 93
going 3
down 90
the 193
dance 7
so 797
he 962
inquired 1
who 79
she 199
was 93
and 51
got 14
introduced 1
and 51
asked 1
her 181
for 484
the 193
two 14
next 2
then 5
the 193
two 14
third 4
he 962
danced 1
with 34
miss 71
king 23
and 51
the 193
two 14
fourth 4
with 34
maria 12
lucas 1
and 51
the 193
two 14
fifth 4
with 34
jane 8
again 2
and 51
the 193
two 14
sixth 3
with 34
lizzy 2
and 51
the 193
if 8
he 962
had 11
had 11
any 17
compassion 4
for 484
me 1041
cried 1
her 181
husband 10
impatiently 1
he 962
would 5
not 85
have 11
danced 1
half 23
so 797
much 2
for 484
god's 1
sake 2
say 7
no 896
more 11
of 109
his 43
partners 4
oh 17
that 11
he 962
had 11
sprained 1
his 43
ankle 9
in 2719
the 193
first 8
dance 7
oh 17
my 90
dear 15
i 4330
am 392
quite 1
delighted 2
with 34
him 9
he 962
is 124
so 797
excessively 1
handsome 6
and 51
his 43
sisters 1
are 12
charming 2
women 5
i 4330
never 3
in 2719
my 90
life 44
saw 24
anything 3
more 11
elegant 2
than 22
their 2
dresses 1
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
the 193
lace 18
upon 1
mrs 1
hurst's 1
gown 5
here 31
she 199
was 93
interrupted 1
again 2
mr 5
bennet 1
protested 1
against 1
any 17
description 3
of 109
finery 2
she 199
was 93
therefore 1
obliged 1
to 805
seek 6
another 1
branch 6
of 109
the 193
subject 11
and 51
related 3
with 34
much 2
bitterness 2
of 109
spirit 20
and 51
some 30
exaggeration 3
the 193
shocking 2
rudeness 2
of 109
mr 5
darcy 2
but 82
i 4330
can 287
assure 6
you 29
she 199
added 1
that 11
lizzy 2
does 5
not 85
lose 5
much 2
by 57
not 85
suiting 2
his 43
fancy 5
for 484
he 962
is 124
a 6799
most 3
disagreeable 3
horrid 2
man 342
not 85
at 272
all 162
worth 15
pleasing 3
so 797
high 54
and 51
so 797
conceited 4
that 11
there 21
was 93
no 896
enduring 1
him 9
he 962
walked 1
here 31
and 51
he 962
walked 1
there 21
fancying 1
himself 1
so 797
very 1
great 12
not 85
handsome 6
enough 2
to 805
dance 7
with 34
i 4330
wish 13
you 29
had 11
been 1
there 21
my 90
dear 15
to 805
have 11
given 3
him 9
one 19
of 109
your 4
set 40
downs 26
i 4330
quite 1
detest 8
the 193
man 342
chapter 3
when 6
jane 8
and 51
elizabeth 5
were 5
alone 1
the 193
former 3
who 79
had 11
been 1
cautious 4
in 2719
her 181
praise 7
of 109
mr 5
before 2
expressed 1
to 805
her 181
sister 9
just 24
how 27
very 1
much 2
she 199
admired 1
him 9
he 962
is 124
just 24
what 14
a 6799
young 9
man 342
ought 2
to 805
be 1200
said 1
she 199
sensible 3
good 28
lively 1
and 51
i 4330
never 3
saw 24
such 2
happy 1
manners 1
so 797
much 2
ease 10
with 34
such 2
perfect 24
good 28
breeding 2
he 962
is 124
also 3
handsome 6
replied 1
elizabeth 5
which 2
a 6799
young 9
man 342
ought 2
likewise 1
to 805
be 1200
if 8
he 962
possibly 1
can 287
his 43
character 16
is 124
thereby 1
complete 8
i 4330
was 93
very 1
much 2
flattered 1
by 57
his 43
asking 1
me 1041
to 805
dance 7
a 6799
second 16
time 45
i 4330
did 23
not 85
expect 20
such 2
a 6799
compliment 6
did 23
not 85
you 29
i 4330
did 23
for 484
you 29
but 82
that 11
is 124
one 19
great 12
difference 3
between 1
us 70
compliments 1
always 1
take 18
you 29
by 57
surprise 4
and 51
me 1041
never 3
what 14
could 2
be 1200
more 11
natural 18
than 22
his 43
asking 1
you 29
again 2
he 962
could 2
not 85
help 23
seeing 2
that 11
you 29
were 5
about 1
five 5
times 10
as 509
pretty 3
as 509
every 10
other 5
woman 21
in 2719
the 193
room 22
no 896
thanks 4
to 805
his 43
gallantry 2
for 484
that 11
well 24
he 962
certainly 1
is 124
very 1
agreeable 3
and 51
i 4330
give 15
you 29
leave 14
to 805
like 22
him 9
you 29
have 11
liked 1
many 2
a 6799
stupider 1
person 33
dear 15
lizzy 2
oh 17
you 29
are 12
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
too 50
apt 9
you 29
know 12
to 805
like 22
people 4
in 2719
general 22
you 29
never 3
see 70
a 6799
fault 20
in 2719
anybody 2
all 162
the 193
world 12
are 12
good 28
and 51
agreeable 3
in 2719
your 4
eyes 8
i 4330
never 3
heard 1
you 29
speak 12
ill 84
of 109
a 6799
human 41
being 3
in 2719
your 4
life 44
i 4330
would 5
not 85
wish 13
to 805
be 1200
hasty 1
in 2719
censuring 1
anyone 2
but 82
i 4330
always 1
speak 12
what 14
i 4330
think 8
i 4330
know 12
you 29
do 814
and 51
it 67
is 124
that 11
which 2
makes 4
the 193
wonder 17
with 34
your 4
good 28
sense 8
to 805
be 1200
so 797
honestly 1
blind 22
to 805
the 193
follies 1
and 51
nonsense 2
of 109
others 1
affectation 3
of 109
is 124
common 23
enough 2
one 19
meets 1
with 34
it 67
everywhere 1
but 82
to 805
be 1200
candid 16
without 1
ostentation 2
or 333
design 16
to 805
take 18
the 193
good 28
of 109
everybody's 1
character 16
and 51
make 17
it 67
still 13
better 7
and 51
say 7
nothing 5
of 109
the 193
bad 33
belongs 1
to 805
you 29
alone 1
and 51
so 797
you 29
like 22
this 6
man's 1
sisters 1
too 50
do 814
you 29
their 2
manners 1
are 12
not 85
equal 17
to 805
his 43
certainly 1
not 85
at 272
first 8
but 82
they 5
are 12
very 1
pleasing 3
women 5
when 6
you 29
converse 5
with 34
them 9
miss 71
is 124
to 805
live 43
with 34
her 181
brother 9
and 51
keep 11
his 43
house 87
and 51
i 4330
am 392
much 2
mistaken 2
if 8
we 444
shall 12
not 85
find 10
a 6799
very 1
charming 2
in 2719
her 181
elizabeth 5
listened 1
in 2719
silence 7
but 82
was 93
not 85
convinced 1
their 2
at 272
the 193
assembly 8
had 11
not 85
been 1
calculated 2
to 805
please 3
in 2719
general 22
and 51
with 34
more 11
quickness 2
of 109
observation 4
and 51
less 19
pliancy 2
of 109
temper 22
than 22
her 181
sister 9
and 51
with 34
a 6799
too 50
by 57
any 17
attention 3
to 805
herself 1
she 199
was 93
very 1
little 6
disposed 1
to 805
approve 3
them 9
they 5
were 5
in 2719
fact 35
very 1
fine 17
ladies 1
not 85
deficient 1
in 2719
good 28
when 6
they 5
were 5
pleased 1
nor 102
in 2719
the 193
power 19
of 109
making 4
themselves 1
agreeable 3
when 6
they 5
chose 2
it 67
but 82
proud 5
and 51
conceited 4
they 5
were 5
rather 2
handsome 6
had 11
been 1
educated 1
in 2719
one 19
of 109
the 193
first 8
private 9
seminaries 1
in 2719
town 27
had 11
a 6799
fortune 8
of 109
twenty 2
thousand 7
pounds 1
were 5
in 2719
the 193
habit 25
of 109
spending 2
more 11
than 22
they 5
ought 2
and 51
of 109
associating 1
with 34
people 4
of 109
rank 19
and 51
were 5
therefore 1
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
entitled 1
to 805
think 8
well 24
of 109
themselves 1
and 51
meanly 1
of 109
others 1
they 5
were 5
of 109
a 6799
respectable 1
family 2
in 2719
the 193
north 42
of 109
england 2
a 6799
circumstance 4
more 11
deeply 1
impressed 1
on 86
their 2
memories 1
than 22
that 11
their 2
brother's 1
fortune 8
and 51
their 2
own 9
had 11
been 1
acquired 1
by 57
trade 20
mr 5
inherited 1
property 2
to 805
the 193
amount 5
of 109
nearly 1
a 6799
hundred 10
thousand 7
pounds 1
from 2
his 43
father 12
who 79
had 11
intended 3
to 805
purchase 7
an 970
estate 3
but 82
did 23
not 85
live 43
to 805
do 814
it 67
mr 5
intended 3
it 67
likewise 1
and 51
sometimes 1
made 13
choice 5
of 109
his 43
county 3
but 82
as 509
he 962
was 93
now 10
provided 1
with 34
a 6799
good 28
house 87
and 51
the 193
liberty 2
of 109
a 6799
manor 4
it 67
was 93
doubtful 4
to 805
many 2
of 109
those 1
who 79
best 37
knew 1
the 193
easiness 2
of 109
his 43
temper 22
whether 1
he 962
might 9
not 85
spend 11
the 193
remainder 5
of 109
his 43
days 1
at 272
and 51
leave 14
the 193
next 2
generation 4
to 805
purchase 7
his 43
sisters 1
were 5
anxious 4
for 484
his 43

an 970
estate 3
of 109
his 43
own 9

though 12
he 962
was 93
now 10
only 1
established 1
as 509
a 6799
tenant 7
miss 71
was 93
by 57
no 896
means 1
unwilling 4
to 805
preside 10
at 272
his 43
table 27
nor 102
was 93
mrs 1
hurst 2
who 79
had 11
married 3
a 6799
man 342
of 109
more 11
fashion 10
than 22
fortune 8
less 19
disposed 1
to 805
consider 13
his 43
house 87
as 509
her 181
home 90
when 6
it 67
suited 1
her 181
mr 5
had 11
not 85
been 1
of 109
age 24
two 14
years 1
when 6
he 962
was 93
tempted 1
by 57
an 970
accidental 4
recommendation 3
to 805
look 14
at 272
house 87
he 962
did 23
look 14
at 272
it 67
and 51
into 26
it 67
for 484
half 23
an 970
hour 10
was 93
pleased 1
with 34
the 193
situation 3
and 51
the 193
principal 7
rooms 1
satisfied 1
with 34
what 14
the 193
owner 5
said 1
in 2719
its 2
praise 7
and 51
took 1
it 67
immediately 1
between 1
him 9
and 51
darcy 2
there 21
was 93
a 6799
very 1
steady 3
friendship 3
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
great 12
opposition 3
of 109
character 16
was 93
endeared 1
to 805
darcy 2
by 57
the 193
easiness 2
openness 2
and 51
ductility 2
of 109
his 43
temper 22
though 12
no 896
disposition 3
could 2
offer 10
a 6799
greater 1
contrast 5
to 805
his 43
own 9
and 51
though 12
with 34
his 43
own 9
he 962
never 3
appeared 1
dissatisfied 1
on 86
the 193
strength 10
of 109
darcy's 1
regard 7
had 11
the 193
firmest 1
reliance 2
and 51
of 109
his 43
the 193
highest 1
opinion 4
in 2719
understanding 4
darcy 2
was 93
the 193
superior 5
was 93
by 57
no 896
means 1
deficient 1
but 82
darcy 2
was 93
clever 6
he 962
was 93
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
haughty 1
reserved 4
and 51
fastidious 4
and 51
his 43
manners 1
though 12
well 24
bred 1
were 5
not 85
inviting 2
in 2719
that 11
respect 18
his 43
friend 14
had 11
greatly 1
the 193
advantage 6
was 93
sure 11
of 109
being 3
liked 1
wherever 1
he 962
appeared 1
darcy 2
was 93
continually 1
giving 2
offense 3
the 193
manner 8
in 2719
which 2
they 5
spoke 14
of 109
the 193
assembly 8
was 93
sufficiently 1
characteristic 4
had 11
never 3
met 180
with 34
more 11
pleasant 9
people 4
or 333
prettier 1
girls 1
in 2719
his 43
life 44
everybody 2
had 11
been 1
most 3
kind 31
and 51
attentive 4
to 805
him 9
there 21
had 11
been 1
no 896
formality 2
no 896
stiffness 2
he 962
had 11
soon 3
felt 5
acquainted 1
with 34
all 162
the 193
room 22
and 51
as 509
to 805
miss 71
bennet 1
he 962
could 2
not 85
conceive 3
an 970
angel 27
more 11
beautiful 2
darcy 2
on 86
the 193
contrary 2
had 11
seen 1
a 6799
collection 3
of 109
people 4
in 2719
whom 3
there 21
was 93
little 6
beauty 2
and 51
no 896
fashion 10
for 484
none 32
of 109
whom 3
he 962
had 11
felt 5
the 193
smallest 1
interest 6
and 51
from 2
none 32
received 1
either 1
attention 3
or 333
pleasure 5
miss 71
bennet 1
he 962
acknowledged 1
to 805
be 1200
pretty 3
but 82
she 199
smiled 1
too 50
much 2
mrs 1
hurst 2
and 51
her 181
sister 9
allowed 1
it 67
to 805
be 1200
so 797
but 82
still 13
they 5
admired 1
her 181
and 51
liked 1
her 181
and 51
pronounced 1
her 181
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
sweet 33
girl 14
and 51
one 19
whom 3
they 5
would 5
not 85
object 26
to 805
know 12
more 11
of 109
miss 71
bennet 1
was 93
therefore 1
established 1
as 509
a 6799
sweet 33
girl 14
and 51
their 2
brother 9
felt 5
authorized 1
by 57
such 2
commendation 3
to 805
think 8
of 109
her 181
as 509
he 962
chose 2
chapter 3
within 3
a 6799
short 62
walk 25
of 109
lived 1
a 6799
family 2
with 34
whom 3
the 193
were 5
particularly 1
intimate 5
sir 22
william 3
lucas 1
had 11
been 1
formerly 1
in 2719
trade 20
in 2719
where 21
he 962
had 11
made 13
a 6799
tolerable 1
fortune 8
and 51
risen 1
to 805
the 193
of 109
knighthood 3
by 57
an 970
address 9
to 805
the 193
king 23
during 1
his 43
mayoralty 2
the 193
distinction 3
had 11
perhaps 1
been 1
felt 5
too 50
strongly 1
it 67
had 11
given 3
him 9
a 6799
disgust 7
to 805
his 43
business 13
and 51
to 805
his 43
residence 3
in 2719
a 6799
small 14
market 18
town 27
and 51
in 2719
quitting 1
them 9
both 8
he 962
had 11
removed 1
with 34
his 43
family 2
to 805
a 6799
house 87
about 1
a 6799
mile 15
from 2
denominated 1
from 2
that 11
period 16
lucas 1
lodge 7
where 21
he 962
could 2
think 8
with 34
pleasure 5
of 109
his 43
own 9
importance 2
and 51
unshackled 1
by 57
business 13
occupy 2
himself 1
solely 1
in 2719
being 3
civil 15
to 805
all 162
the 193
world 12
for 484
though 12
elated 2
by 57
his 43
rank 19
it 67
did 23
not 85
render 7
him 9
supercilious 4
on 86
the 193
contrary 2
he 962
was 93
all 162
attention 3
to 805
everybody 2
by 57
nature 3
inoffensive 4
friendly 2
and 51
obliging 2
his 43
presentation 3
at 272
st 1910
james's 1
had 11
made 13
him 9
courteous 4
lady 18
lucas 1
was 93
a 6799
very 1
good 28
kind 31
of 109
woman 21
not 85
too 50
clever 6
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
valuable 3
to 805
mrs 1
bennet 1
they 5
had 11
several 3
children 1
the 193
eldest 1
of 109
them 9
a 6799
sensible 3
intelligent 4
young 9
woman 21
about 1
twenty 2
seven 18
was 93
elizabeth's 1
intimate 5
friend 14
that 11
the 193
miss 71
and 51
the 193
miss 71
should 7
meet 9
to 805
talk 18
over 596
a 6799
ball 77
was 93
absolutely 1
necessary 2
and 51
the 193
morning 3
after 48
the 193
assembly 8
brought 1
the 193
former 3
to 805
to 805
hear 76
and 51
to 805
communicate 3
you 29
began 1
the 193
evening 3
well 24
charlotte 4
said 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
with 34
civil 15
self 11
command 21
to 805
miss 71
lucas 1
you 29
were 5
mr 5
first 8
choice 5
yes 16
but 82
he 962
seemed 1
to 805
like 22
his 43
second 16
better 7
oh 17
you 29
mean 36
jane 8
i 4330
suppose 4
because 1
he 962
danced 1
with 34
her 181
twice 1
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
that 11
did 23
seem 10
as 509
if 8
he 962
admired 1
her 181
indeed 1
i 4330
rather 2
believe 6
he 962
did 23
i 4330
heard 1
something 3
about 1
it 67
but 82
i 4330
hardly 1
know 12
what 14
something 3
about 1
mr 5
robinson 1
perhaps 1
you 29
mean 36
what 14
i 4330
overheard 1
between 1
him 9
and 51
mr 5
robinson 1
did 23
not 85
i 4330
mention 5
it 67
to 805
you 29
mr 5
asking 1
him 9
how 27
he 962
liked 1
our 3
assemblies 1
and 51
whether 1
he 962
did 23
not 85
think 8
there 21
were 5
a 6799
great 12
many 2
pretty 3
women 5
in 2719
the 193
room 22
and 51
which 2
he 962
thought 11
the 193
prettiest 1
and 51
his 43
answering 1
immediately 1
to 805
the 193
last 7
question 16
the 193
eldest 1
miss 71
bennet 1
beyond 1
a 6799
doubt 15
there 21
cannot 1
be 1200
two 14
opinions 1
on 86
that 11
point 22
upon 1
my 90
word 26
well 24
that 11
is 124
very 1
decided 2
indeed 1
that 11
does 5
seem 10
as 509
if 8
but 82
however 1
it 67
may 49
all 162
come 36
to 805
nothing 5
you 29
know 12
my 90
were 5
more 11
to 805
the 193
purpose 12
than 22
yours 3
eliza 7
said 1
charlotte 4
mr 5
darcy 2
is 124
not 85
so 797
well 24
worth 15
listening 1
to 805
as 509
his 43
friend 14
is 124
he 962
poor 11
eliza 7
to 805
be 1200
only 1
just 24
tolerable 1
i 4330
beg 59
you 29
would 5
not 85
put 47
it 67
into 26
lizzy's 1
head 140
to 805
be 1200
vexed 1
by 57
his 43
ill 84
treatment 3
for 484
he 962
is 124
such 2
a 6799
disagreeable 3
man 342
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
quite 1
a 6799
misfortune 3
to 805
be 1200
liked 1
by 57
him 9
mrs 1
long 49
told 1
me 1041
last 7
night 61
that 11
he 962
sat 92
close 22
to 805
her 181
for 484
half 23
an 970
hour 10
without 1
once 2
opening 3
his 43
lips 8
are 12
you 29
quite 1
sure 11
ma'am 1
is 124
not 85
there 21
a 6799
little 6
mistake 5
said 1
jane 8
i 4330
certainly 1
saw 24
mr 5
darcy 2
speaking 2
to 805
her 181
aye 4
because 1
she 199
asked 1
him 9
at 272
last 7
how 27
he 962
liked 1
and 51
he 962
could 2
not 85
help 23
answering 1
her 181
but 82
she 199
said 1
he 962
seemed 1
quite 1
angry 1
at 272
being 3
spoke 14
to 805
miss 71
told 1
me 1041
said 1
jane 8
that 11
he 962
never 3
speaks 1
much 2
unless 1
among 1
his 43
intimate 5
acquaintances 3
with 34
them 9
he 962
is 124
remarkably 1
agreeable 3
i 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
a 6799
word 26
of 109
it 67
my 90
dear 15
if 8
he 962
had 11
been 1
so 797
very 1
agreeable 3
he 962
would 5
have 11
talked 1
to 805
mrs 1
long 49
but 82
i 4330
can 287
guess 16
how 27
it 67
was 93
everybody 2
says 1
that 11
he 962
is 124
eat 15
up 194
with 34
pride 6
and 51
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
he 962
had 11
heard 1
somehow 1
that 11
mrs 1
long 49
does 5
not 85
keep 11
a 6799
carriage 5
and 51
had 11
come 36
to 805
the 193
ball 77
in 2719
a 6799
hack 28
chaise 3
i 4330
do 814
not 85
mind 25
his 43
not 85
talking 1
to 805
mrs 1
long 49
said 1
miss 71
lucas 1
but 82
i 4330
wish 13
he 962
had 11
danced 1
with 34
eliza 7
another 1
time 45
lizzy 2
said 1
her 181
mother 21
i 4330
would 5
not 85
dance 7
with 34
him 9
if 8
i 4330
were 5
you 29
i 4330
believe 6
ma'am 1
i 4330
may 49
safely 1
promise 4
you 29
never 3
to 805
dance 7
with 34
him 9
his 43
pride 6
said 1
miss 71
lucas 1
does 5
not 85
offend 7
me 1041
so 797
much 2
as 509
pride 6
often 4
does 5
because 1
there 21
is 124
an 970
excuse 4
for 484
it 67
one 19
cannot 1
wonder 17
that 11
so 797
very 1
fine 17
a 6799
young 9
man 342
with 34
family 2
fortune 8
everything 2
in 2719
his 43
should 7
think 8
highly 1
of 109
himself 1
if 8
i 4330
may 49
so 797
express 25
it 67
he 962
has 41
a 6799
right 31
to 805
be 1200
proud 5
that 11
is 124
very 1
true 9
replied 1
elizabeth 5
and 51
i 4330
could 2
easily 1
forgive 8
his 43
pride 6
if 8
he 962
had 11
not 85
mortified 1
mine 26
pride 6
observed 1
mary 13
who 79
piqued 1
herself 1
upon 1
the 193
solidity 2
of 109
her 181
reflections 1
is 124
a 6799
very 1
common 23
failing 3
i 4330
believe 6
by 57
all 162
that 11
i 4330
have 11
ever 33
read 49
i 4330
am 392
convinced 1
that 11
it 67
is 124
very 1
common 23
indeed 1
that 11
human 41
nature 3
is 124
particularly 1
prone 3
to 805
it 67
and 51
that 11
there 21
are 12
very 1
few 6
of 109
us 70
who 79
do 814
not 85
cherish 4
a 6799
feeling 4
of 109
self 11
complacency 2
on 86
the 193
score 19
of 109
some 30
quality 2
or 333
other 5
real 47
or 333
imaginary 1
vanity 2
and 51
pride 6
are 12
different 11
things 1
though 12
the 193
words 5
are 12
often 4
used 1
a 6799
person 33
may 49
be 1200
proud 5
without 1
being 3
vain 8
pride 6
relates 1
more 11
to 805
our 3
opinion 4
of 109
ourselves 1
vanity 2
to 805
what 14
we 444
would 5
have 11
others 1
think 8
of 109
us 70
if 8
i 4330
were 5
as 509
rich 19
as 509
mr 5
darcy 2
cried 1
a 6799
young 9
lucas 1
who 79
came 36
with 34
his 43
sisters 1
i 4330
should 7
not 85
care 47
how 27
proud 5
i 4330
was 93
i 4330
would 5
keep 11
a 6799
pack 29
of 109
foxhounds 1
and 51
drink 9
a 6799
bottle 10
of 109
wine 18
a 6799
day 27
then 5
you 29
would 5
drink 9
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
more 11
than 22
you 29
ought 2
said 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
and 51
if 8
i 4330
were 5
to 805
see 70
you 29
at 272
it 67
i 4330
should 7
take 18
away 1
your 4
bottle 10
directly 1
the 193
boy 25
protested 1
that 11
she 199
should 7
not 85
she 199
continued 1
to 805
declare 6
that 11
she 199
would 5
and 51
the 193
argument 9
ended 1
only 1
with 34
the 193
visit 14
chapter 3
the 193
ladies 1
of 109
soon 3
waited 1
on 86
those 1
of 109
the 193
visit 14
was 93
soon 3
returned 1
in 2719
due 21
form 68
miss 71
pleasing 3
manners 1
grew 1
on 86
the 193
goodwill 2
of 109
mrs 1
hurst 2
and 51
miss 71
and 51
though 12
the 193
mother 21
was 93
found 18
to 805
be 1200
intolerable 1
and 51
the 193
younger 1
sisters 1
not 85
worth 15
speaking 2
to 805
a 6799
wish 13
of 109
being 3
better 7
acquainted 1
with 34
them 9
was 93
expressed 1
towards 1
the 193
two 14
eldest 1
by 57
jane 8
this 6
attention 3
was 93
received 1
with 34
the 193
greatest 1
pleasure 5
but 82
elizabeth 5
still 13
saw 24
superciliousness 2
in 2719
their 2
treatment 3
of 109
everybody 2
hardly 1
excepting 1
even 36
her 181
sister 9
and 51
could 2
not 85
like 22
them 9
though 12
their 2
kindness 3
to 805
jane 8
such 2
as 509
it 67
was 93
had 11
a 6799
value 8
as 509
arising 1
in 2719
all 162
probability 2
from 2
the 193
influence 4
of 109
their 2
brother's 1
admiration 2
it 67
was 93
generally 1
evident 2
whenever 1
they 5
met 180
that 11
he 962
did 23
admire 6
her 181
and 51
to 805
her 181
it 67
was 93
equally 1
evident 2
that 11
jane 8
was 93
yielding 2
to 805
the 193
preference 3
which 2
she 199
had 11
begun 1
to 805
entertain 12
for 484
him 9
from 2
the 193
first 8
and 51
was 93
in 2719
a 6799
way 27
to 805
be 1200
very 1
much 2
in 2719
love 29
but 82
she 199
considered 1
with 34
pleasure 5
that 11
it 67
was 93
not 85
likely 1
to 805
be 1200
discovered 1
by 57
the 193
world 12
in 2719
general 22
since 7
jane 8
united 2
with 34
great 12
strength 10
of 109
feeling 4
a 6799
composure 2
of 109
temper 22
and 51
a 6799
uniform 8
cheerfulness 2
of 109
manner 8
which 2
would 5
guard 26
her 181
from 2
the 193
suspicions 1
of 109
the 193
impertinent 2
she 199
mentioned 1
this 6
to 805
her 181
friend 14
miss 71
lucas 1
it 67
may 49
perhaps 1
be 1200
pleasant 9
replied 1
charlotte 4
to 805
be 1200
able 3
to 805
impose 6
on 86
the 193
public 18
in 2719
such 2
a 6799
case 25
but 82
it 67
is 124
sometimes 1
a 6799
disadvantage 6
to 805
be 1200
so 797
very 1
guarded 2
if 8
a 6799
woman 21
conceals 1
her 181
affection 5
with 34
the 193
same 5
skill 11
from 2
the 193
object 26
of 109
it 67
she 199
may 49
lose 5
the 193
opportunity 2
of 109
fixing 3
him 9
and 51
it 67
will 39
then 5
be 1200
but 82
poor 11
consolation 3
to 805
believe 6
the 193
world 12
equally 1
in 2719
the 193
dark 19
there 21
is 124
so 797
much 2
of 109
gratitude 2
or 333
vanity 2
in 2719
almost 1
every 10
attachment 3
that 11
it 67
is 124
not 85
safe 20
to 805
leave 14
any 17
to 805
itself 1
we 444
can 287
all 162
begin 8
freely 1
a 6799
slight 10
preference 3
is 124
natural 18
enough 2
but 82
there 21
are 12
very 1
few 6
of 109
us 70
who 79
have 11
heart 57
enough 2
to 805
be 1200
really 1
in 2719
love 29
without 1
encouragement 3
in 2719
nine 21
cases 1
out 365
of 109
ten 151
a 6799
woman 21
had 11
better 7
show 64
more 11
affection 5
than 22
she 199
feels 1
likes 2
your 4
sister 9
undoubtedly 1
but 82
he 962
may 49
never 3
do 814
more 11
than 22
like 22
her 181
if 8
she 199
does 5
not 85
help 23
him 9
on 86
but 82
she 199
does 5
help 23
him 9
on 86
as 509
much 2
as 509
her 181
nature 3
will 39
allow 9
if 8
i 4330
can 287
perceive 3
her 181
regard 7
for 484
him 9
he 962
must 28
be 1200
a 6799
simpleton 3
indeed 1
not 85
to 805
discover 10
it 67
too 50
remember 4
eliza 7
that 11
he 962
does 5
not 85
know 12
disposition 3
as 509
you 29
do 814
but 82
if 8
a 6799
woman 21
is 124
partial 6
to 805
a 6799
man 342
and 51
does 5
not 85
to 805
conceal 10
it 67
he 962
must 28
find 10
it 67
out 365
perhaps 1
he 962
must 28
if 8
he 962
sees 6
enough 2
of 109
her 181
but 82
though 12
and 51
jane 8
meet 9
tolerably 1
often 4
it 67
is 124
never 3
for 484
many 2
hours 1
together 3
and 51
as 509
they 5
always 1
see 70
each 1
other 5
in 2719
large 11
mixed 1
parties 1
it 67
is 124
impossible 2
that 11
every 10
moment 14
should 7
be 1200
employed 1
in 2719
conversing 1
together 3
jane 8
should 7
therefore 1
make 17
the 193
most 3
of 109
every 10
half 23
hour 10
in 2719
which 2
she 199
can 287
command 21
his 43
attention 3
when 6
she 199
is 124
secure 6
of 109
him 9
there 21
will 39
be 1200
more 11
leisure 8
for 484
falling 1
in 2719
love 29
as 509
much 2
as 509
she 199
chooses 1
your 4
plan 61
is 124
a 6799
good 28
one 19
replied 1
elizabeth 5
where 21
nothing 5
is 124
in 2719
question 16
but 82
the 193
desire 6
of 109
being 3
well 24
married 3
and 51
if 8
i 4330
were 5
determined 2
to 805
get 13
a 6799
rich 19
husband 10
or 333
any 17
husband 10
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
i 4330
should 7
adopt 12
it 67
but 82
these 4
are 12
not 85
feelings 1
she 199
is 124
not 85
acting 2
by 57
design 16
as 509
yet 4
she 199
cannot 1
even 36
be 1200
certain 5
of 109
the 193
degree 3
of 109
her 181
own 9
regard 7
nor 102
of 109
its 2
reasonableness 2
she 199
has 41
known 1
him 9
only 1
a 6799
fortnight 4
she 199
danced 1
four 26
dances 1
with 34
him 9
at 272
she 199
saw 24
him 9
one 19
morning 3
at 272
his 43
own 9
house 87
and 51
has 41
since 7
dined 1
with 34
him 9
in 2719
company 2
four 26
times 10
this 6
is 124
not 85
quite 1
enough 2
to 805
make 17
her 181
understand 8
his 43
character 16
not 85
as 509
you 29
represent 11
it 67
had 11
she 199
merely 1
dined 1
with 34
him 9
she 199
might 9
only 1
have 11
discovered 1
whether 1
he 962
had 11
a 6799
good 28
appetite 3
but 82
you 29
must 28
remember 4
that 11
four 26
evenings 1
have 11
also 3
been 1
spent 1
together 3
and 51
four 26
evenings 1
may 49
do 814
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
yes 16
these 4
four 26
evenings 1
have 11
enabled 1
them 9
to 805
ascertain 7
that 11
they 5
both 8
like 22
un 1981
better 7
than 22
commerce 2
but 82
with 34
respect 18
to 805
any 17
other 5
leading 2
characteristic 4
i 4330
do 814
not 85
imagine 3
that 11
much 2
has 41
been 1
unfolded 1
well 24
said 1
charlotte 4
i 4330
wish 13
jane 8
success 13
with 34
all 162
my 90
heart 57
and 51
if 8
she 199
were 5
married 3
to 805
him 9
to 805
morrow 3
i 4330
should 7
think 8
she 199
had 11
as 509
good 28
a 6799
chance 20
of 109
happiness 2
as 509
if 8
she 199
were 5
to 805
be 1200
studying 1
his 43
character 16
for 484
a 6799
twelvemonth 3
happiness 2
in 2719
marriage 6
is 124
entirely 1
a 6799
matter 7
of 109
chance 20
if 8
the 193
dispositions 1
of 109
the 193
parties 1
are 12
ever 33
so 797
well 24
known 1
to 805
each 1
other 5
or 333
ever 33
so 797
similar 5
beforehand 1
it 67
does 5
not 85
advance 7
their 2
felicity 2
in 2719
the 193
least 3
they 5
always 1
continue 3
to 805
grow 21
sufficiently 1
unlike 10
afterwards 1
to 805
have 11
their 2
share 22
of 109
vexation 3
and 51
it 67
is 124
better 7
to 805
know 12
as 509
little 6
as 509
possible 3
of 109
the 193
defects 1
of 109
the 193
person 33
with 34
whom 3
you 29
are 12
to 805
pass 66
your 4
life 44
you 29
make 17
me 1041
laugh 14
charlotte 4
but 82
it 67
is 124
not 85
sound 29
you 29
know 12
it 67
is 124
not 85
sound 29
and 51
that 11
you 29
would 5
never 3
act 69
in 2719
this 6
way 27
yourself 1
occupied 1
in 2719
observing 1
mr 5
attentions 1
to 805
her 181
sister 9
elizabeth 5
was 93
far 91
from 2
suspecting 1
that 11
she 199
was 93
herself 1
becoming 2
an 970
object 26
of 109
some 30
interest 6
in 2719
the 193
eyes 8
of 109
his 43
friend 14
mr 5
darcy 2
had 11
at 272
first 8
scarcely 1
allowed 1
her 181
to 805
be 1200
pretty 3
he 962
had 11
looked 1
at 272
her 181
without 1
admiration 2
at 272
the 193
ball 77
and 51
when 6
they 5
next 2
met 180
he 962
looked 1
at 272
her 181
only 1
to 805
but 82
no 896
sooner 1
had 11
he 962
made 13
it 67
clear 23
to 805
himself 1
and 51
his 43
friends 4
that 11
she 199
hardly 1
had 11
a 6799
good 28
feature 5
in 2719
her 181
face 19
than 22
he 962
began 1
to 805
find 10
it 67
was 93
rendered 1
uncommonly 1
intelligent 4
by 57
the 193
beautiful 2
expression 11
of 109
her 181
dark 19
eyes 8
to 805
this 6
discovery 2
succeeded 1
some 30
others 1
equally 1
mortifying 1
though 12
he 962
had 11
detected 1
with 34
a 6799
critical 2
eye 57
more 11
than 22
one 19
failure 3
of 109
perfect 24
symmetry 2
in 2719
her 181
form 68
he 962
was 93
forced 1
to 805
acknowledge 3
her 181
figure 7
to 805
be 1200
light 42
and 51
pleasing 3
and 51
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
his 43
asserting 1
that 11
her 181
manners 1
were 5
not 85
those 1
of 109
the 193
fashionable 1
world 12
he 962
was 93
caught 1
by 57
their 2
easy 2
playfulness 2
of 109
this 6
she 199
was 93
perfectly 1
unaware 4
to 805
her 181
he 962
was 93
only 1
the 193
man 342
who 79
made 13
himself 1
agreeable 3
nowhere 2
and 51
who 79
had 11
not 85
thought 11
her 181
handsome 6
enough 2
to 805
dance 7
with 34
he 962
began 1
to 805
wish 13
to 805
know 12
more 11
of 109
her 181
and 51
as 509
a 6799
step 48
towards 1
conversing 1
with 34
her 181
himself 1
attended 1
to 805
her 181
conversation 8
with 34
others 1
his 43
doing 3
so 797
drew 2
her 181
notice 8
it 67
was 93
at 272
sir 22
william 3
where 21
a 6799
large 11
party 3
were 5
assembled 1
what 14
does 5
mr 5
darcy 2
mean 36
said 1
she 199
to 805
charlotte 4
by 57
listening 1
to 805
my 90
conversation 8
with 34
colonel 5
forster 1
that 11
is 124
a 6799
question 16
which 2
mr 5
darcy 2
only 1
can 287
answer 8
but 82
if 8
he 962
does 5
it 67
any 17
more 11
i 4330
shall 12
certainly 1
let 50
him 9
know 12
that 11
i 4330
see 70
what 14
he 962
is 124
about 1
he 962
has 41
a 6799
very 1
satirical 2
eye 57
and 51
if 8
i 4330
do 814
not 85
begin 8
by 57
being 3
impertinent 2
myself 1
i 4330
shall 12
soon 3
grow 21
afraid 1
of 109
him 9
on 86
his 43
approaching 1
them 9
soon 3
afterwards 1
though 12
without 1
seeming 2
to 805
have 11
any 17
intention 5
of 109
speaking 2
miss 71
lucas 1
defied 1
her 181
friend 14
to 805
mention 5
such 2
a 6799
subject 11
to 805
him 9
which 2
immediately 1
provoking 2
elizabeth 5
to 805
do 814
it 67
she 199
turned 1
to 805
him 9
and 51
said 1
did 23
you 29
not 85
think 8
mr 5
darcy 2
that 11
i 4330
expressed 1
myself 1
uncommonly 1
well 24
just 24
now 10
when 6
i 4330
was 93
teasing 2
colonel 5
forster 1
to 805
give 15
us 70
a 6799
ball 77
at 272
with 34
great 12
energy 2
but 82
it 67
is 124
always 1
a 6799
subject 11
which 2
makes 4
a 6799
lady 18
energetic 2
you 29
are 12
severe 7
on 86
us 70
it 67
will 39
be 1200
her 181
turn 46
soon 3
to 805
be 1200
teased 1
said 1
miss 71
lucas 1
i 4330
am 392
going 3
to 805
open 21
the 193
instrument 16
eliza 7
and 51
you 29
know 12
what 14
follows 1
you 29
are 12
a 6799
very 1
strange 8
creature 3
by 57
way 27
of 109
a 6799
friend 14
always 1
wanting 1
me 1041
to 805
play 73
and 51
sing 52
before 2
anybody 2
and 51
everybody 2
if 8
my 90
vanity 2
had 11
taken 1
a 6799
musical 9
turn 46
you 29
would 5
have 11
been 1
invaluable 1
but 82
as 509
it 67
is 124
i 4330
would 5
really 1
rather 2
not 85
sit 29
down 90
before 2
those 1
who 79
must 28
be 1200
in 2719
the 193
habit 25
of 109
hearing 3
the 193
very 1
best 37
performers 1
on 86
miss 71
persevering 1
however 1
she 199
added 1
very 1
well 24
if 8
it 67
must 28
be 1200
so 797
it 67
must 28
and 51
gravely 1
glancing 1
at 272
mr 5
darcy 2
there 21
is 124
a 6799
fine 17
old 21
saying 3
which 2
everybody 2
here 31
is 124
of 109
course 10
familiar 12
with 34
your 4
breath 27
to 805
cool 22
your 4
porridge' 1
and 51
i 4330
shall 12
keep 11
mine 26
to 805
swell 13
my 90
song 26
her 181
performance 3
was 93
pleasing 3
though 12
by 57
no 896

neither 1

though 12
vanity 2
had 11
given 3
her 181
application 3
it 67
had 11
given 3
her 181
likewise 1
a 6799
pedantic 2
air 129

conceited 4
manner 8

would 5
have 11
injured 1

gratitude 2
by 57

joined 1
eagerly 1
in 2719

at 272
one 19

of 109
the 193
room 22
mr 5
darcy 2
stood 1
near 15
them 9
in 2719
silent 6
indignation 2
at 272
such 2
a 6799
mode 57
of 109
passing 3
the 193
evening 3
to 805
the 193
exclusion 4
of 109
all 162
conversation 8
and 51
was 93
too 50
much 2
engrossed 1
by 57
his 43
thoughts 1
to 805
perceive 3
that 11
sir 22
william 3
lucas 1
was 93
his 43
till 14
sir 22
william 3
thus 1
began 1
what 14
a 6799
charming 2
amusement 3
for 484
young 9
people 4
this 6
is 124
mr 5
darcy 2
there 21
is 124
nothing 5
like 22
dancing 2
after 48
all 162
i 4330
consider 13
it 67
as 509
one 19
of 109
the 193
first 8
refinements 1
of 109
polished 1
society 2
certainly 1
sir 22
and 51
it 67
has 41
the 193
advantage 6
also 3
of 109
being 3
in 2719
vogue 3
the 193
less 19
polished 1
societies 1
of 109
the 193
world 12
every 10
savage 12
can 287
dance 7
sir 22
william 3
only 1
smiled 1
your 4
friend 14
performs 1
delightfully 1
he 962
continued 1
after 48
a 6799
pause 4
on 86
seeing 2
join 16
the 193
group 15
and 51
i 4330
doubt 15
not 85
that 11
you 29
are 12
an 970
adept 6
in 2719
the 193
science 3
yourself 1
mr 5
darcy 2
you 29
saw 24
me 1041
dance 7
at 272
i 4330
believe 6
sir 22
yes 16
indeed 1
and 51
received 1
no 896
inconsiderable 1
pleasure 5
from 2
the 193
sight 17
do 814
you 29
often 4
dance 7
at 272
st 1910
james's 1
never 3
sir 22
do 814
you 29
not 85
think 8
it 67
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
proper 9
compliment 6
to 805
the 193
place 29
it 67
is 124
a 6799
compliment 6
which 2
i 4330
never 3
pay 52
to 805
any 17
place 29
if 8
i 4330
can 287
avoid 8
it 67
you 29
have 11
a 6799
house 87
in 2719
town 27
i 4330
conclude 3
mr 5
darcy 2
bowed 1
i 4330
had 11
once 2
had 11
some 30
thought 11
of 109
fixing 3
in 2719
town 27
myself 1
for 484
i 4330
am 392
fond 17
of 109
superior 5
society 2
but 82
i 4330
did 23
not 85
feel 11
quite 1
certain 5
that 11
the 193
air 129
of 109
london 5
would 5
agree 11
with 34
lady 18
lucas 1
he 962
paused 1
in 2719
hopes 1
of 109
an 970
answer 8
but 82
his 43
companion 10
was 93
not 85
disposed 1
to 805
make 17
any 17
and 51
elizabeth 5
at 272
that 11
instant 11
moving 2
towards 1
them 9
he 962
was 93
struck 1
with 34
the 193
action 4
of 109
doing 3
a 6799
very 1
gallant 6
thing 15
and 51
called 1
out 365
to 805
her 181
my 90
dear 15
miss 71
eliza 7
why 4
are 12
you 29
not 85
dancing 2
mr 5
darcy 2
you 29
must 28
allow 9
me 1041
to 805
present 20
this 6
young 9
lady 18
to 805
you 29
as 509
a 6799
very 1
desirable 3
partner 8
you 29
cannot 1
refuse 4
to 805
dance 7
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
when 6
so 797
much 2
beauty 2
is 124
before 2
you 29
and 51
taking 4
her 181
hand 137
he 962
would 5
have 11
given 3
it 67
to 805
mr 5
darcy 2
who 79
though 12
extremely 1
surprised 1
was 93
not 85
unwilling 4
to 805
receive 8
it 67
when 6
she 199
instantly 1
drew 2
back 182
and 51
said 1
with 34
some 30
discomposure 2
to 805
sir 22
william 3
indeed 1
sir 22
i 4330
have 11
not 85
the 193
least 3
intention 5
of 109
dancing 2
i 4330
entreat 8
you 29
not 85
to 805
suppose 4
that 11
i 4330
moved 1
this 6
way 27
in 2719
order 11
to 805
beg 59
for 484
a 6799
partner 8
mr 5
darcy 2
with 34
grave 28
propriety 2
requested 1
to 805
be 1200
allowed 1
the 193
of 109
her 181
hand 137
but 82
in 2719
vain 8
elizabeth 5
was 93
determined 2
nor 102
did 23
sir 22
william 3
at 272
all 162
shake 19
her 181
purpose 12
by 57
his 43
attempt 5
at 272
persuasion 3
you 29
excel 13
so 797
much 2
in 2719
the 193
dance 7
miss 71
eliza 7
that 11
it 67
is 124
cruel 9
to 805
deny 2
me 1041
the 193
happiness 2
of 109
seeing 2
you 29
and 51
though 12
this 6
gentleman 3
dislikes 1
the 193
amusement 3
in 2719
general 22
he 962
can 287
have 11
no 896
objection 5
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
to 805
oblige 3
us 70
for 484
one 19
half 23
hour 10
mr 5
darcy 2
is 124
all 162
politeness 2
said 1
elizabeth 5
smiling 2
he 962
is 124
indeed 1
but 82
considering 1
the 193
inducement 3
my 90
dear 15
miss 71
eliza 7
we 444
cannot 1
wonder 17
at 272
his 43
complaisance 2
for 484
who 79
would 5
object 26
to 805
such 2
a 6799
partner 8
elizabeth 5
looked 1
archly 1
and 51
turned 1
away 1
her 181
resistance 3
had 11
not 85
injured 1
her 181
with 34
the 193
gentleman 3
and 51
he 962
was 93
thinking 2
of 109
her 181
with 34
some 30
complacency 2
when 6
thus 1
accosted 1
by 57
miss 71
i 4330
can 287
guess 16
the 193
subject 11
of 109
your 4
reverie 3
i 4330
should 7
imagine 3
not 85
you 29
are 12
considering 1
how 27
insupportable 1
it 67
would 5
be 1200
to 805
pass 66
many 2
evenings 1
in 2719
this 6
manner 8
in 2719
such 2
society 2
and 51
indeed 1
i 4330
am 392
quite 1
of 109
your 4
opinion 4
i 4330
was 93
never 3
more 11
annoyed 1
the 193
insipidity 2
and 51
yet 4
the 193
noise 11
the 193
nothingness 2
and 51
yet 4
the 193
self 11
importance 2
of 109
all 162
those 1
people 4
what 14
would 5
i 4330
give 15
to 805
hear 76
your 4
strictures 1
on 86
them 9
your 4
conjecture 4
is 124
totally 1
wrong 24
i 4330
assure 6
you 29
my 90
mind 25
was 93
more 11
agreeably 1
engaged 1
i 4330
have 11
been 1
meditating 1
on 86
the 193
very 1
great 12
pleasure 5
which 2
a 6799
pair 7
of 109
fine 17
eyes 8
in 2719
the 193
face 19
of 109
a 6799
pretty 3
woman 21
can 287
bestow 7
miss 71
immediately 1
fixed 2
her 181
eyes 8
on 86
his 43
face 19
and 51
desired 1
he 962
would 5
tell 16
her 181
what 14
lady 18
had 11
the 193
credit 12
of 109
inspiring 1
such 2
reflections 1
mr 5
darcy 2
replied 1
with 34
great 12
intrepidity 2
miss 71
elizabeth 5

miss 71
elizabeth 5

repeated 2
miss 71

all 162
astonishment 2
how 27
long 49
has 41
she 199
been 1
such 2
a 6799
and 51
pray 9
when 6
am 392
i 4330
to 805
wish 13
you 29
joy 36
that 11
is 124
exactly 1
the 193
question 16
which 2
i 4330
expected 1
you 29
to 805
ask 6
a 6799
lady's 1
imagination 3
is 124
very 1
rapid 10
it 67
jumps 4
from 2
admiration 2
to 805
love 29
from 2
love 29
to 805
matrimony 2
in 2719
a 6799
moment 14

be 1200
wishing 1
me 1041

you 29
are 12
serious 4
about 1
it 67

shall 12
consider 13
the 193
matter 7

absolutely 1
settled 1
you 29
will 39
be 1200

a 6799
charming 2
mother 21
in 2719

of 109
course 10
she 199
will 39
always 1
be 1200
at 272
with 34
you 29
he 962
listened 1
to 805
her 181
with 34
perfect 24
indifference 2
while 4
she 199
chose 2
to 805
entertain 12
herself 1
in 2719
this 6
manner 8
and 51
as 509

on 86

though 12
ample 3
for 484
her 181
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
could 2
but 82
ill 84
supply 3
the 193
deficiency 2
of 109
his 43
her 181
father 12

been 1
an 970

only 1
one 19
mile 15
from 2
a 6799
most 3
convenient 2
distance 4
for 484
the 193
young 9
ladies 1
who 79
were 5
usually 1
tempted 1
thither 1
three 12
or 333
four 26
times 10
a 6799
week 20
to 805
pay 52
their 2
duty 2
to 805
their 2

and 51
to 805
a 6799

just 24
over 596

way 27
the 193
two 14
youngest 1
of 109
the 193
family 2
catherine 2
and 51
lydia 4
were 5
particularly 1
frequent 9
in 2719
these 4
attentions 1
their 2
minds 4
were 5
more 11
vacant 2
than 22
their 2
and 51
when 6
nothing 5
better 7
offered 1
a 6799
walk 25
to 805
was 93
necessary 2
to 805
amuse 6
their 2
morning 3
hours 1
and 51
furnish 6
conversation 8
for 484
the 193
evening 3

of 109

be 1200
they 5
always 1
contrived 1
to 805
learn 9
some 30
from 2
their 2
aunt 6
at 272
present 20
indeed 1
they 5
were 5
well 24
supplied 1
both 8
with 34
news 71
and 51
happiness 2
by 57
the 193
recent 6
arrival 3
of 109

was 93

visits 1
to 805
mrs 1
phillips 1
were 5
now 10
productive 4
of 109
the 193
most 3
interesting 2
intelligence 2
every 10
day 27
added 1
something 3
to 805
their 2
knowledge 4
of 109
the 193
names 4
and 51
connections 1
their 2
lodgings 2
were 5
not 85
long 49
a 6799
secret 25
and 51
at 272
length 14
they 5
began 1
to 805
know 12
the 193
officers 1
themselves 1
mr 5
phillips 1
visited 1
them 9
all 162
and 51
this 6
opened 1
to 805
his 43
nieces 1
a 6799
store 16
of 109
felicity 2
unknown 3
before 2
they 5
could 2

the 193
mention 5

eyes 8
when 6
opposed 1

of 109
an 970
ensign 3
after 48
listening 1
one 19
morning 3
to 805
their 2
effusions 1
on 86
this 6
subject 11
mr 5
bennet 1
coolly 1
observed 1
from 2
all 162
that 11

can 287
collect 30
by 57
your 4
manner 8
of 109
talking 1
you 29
must 28
be 1200
two 14
of 109
the 193
silliest 1
girls 1
in 2719
the 193
country 12
i 4330
have 11
suspected 1
it 67
some 30
time 45
but 82
i 4330
am 392
now 10
convinced 1
catherine 2
was 93
disconcerted 1
and 51
made 13
no 896
answer 8
but 82
lydia 4
with 34
perfect 24
indifference 2
continued 1
to 805
express 25
her 181
admiration 2
of 109
captain 8
carter 3
and 51
her 181
hope 16
of 109
seeing 2
him 9
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
the 193
day 27
as 509

astonished 1
my 90
dear 15
said 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
that 11
you 29
should 7
be 1200
so 797
ready 2
to 805
think 8
your 4
own 9
children 1
silly 2
if 8
i 4330
wished 1
to 805
think 8
of 109
anybody's 1
children 1
it 67
should 7
not 85
be 1200
of 109
my 90
own 9
however 1
if 8
my 90
children 1
are 12
silly 2
i 4330
must 28
hope 16
to 805
be 1200
always 1
sensible 3
of 109
it 67
yes 16
but 82
as 509
it 67
happens 4
they 5
are 12
all 162
of 109
them 9
very 1
clever 6
this 6
is 124
the 193
only 1
point 22
i 4330
flatter 10
myself 1
on 86
which 2
we 444
do 814
not 85
agree 11
i 4330
had 11
hoped 1
that 11
our 3
sentiments 1
coincided 1
in 2719
every 10
particular 13
but 82
i 4330
must 28
so 797
far 91
differ 18
from 2
you 29
as 509
to 805
think 8
our 3
two 14
youngest 1
daughters 1
uncommonly 1
foolish 4
my 90
dear 15
mr 5
bennet 1
you 29
must 28
not 85
expect 20
such 2
girls 1
to 805
have 11
the 193
sense 8
of 109
their 2
father 12
and 51
mother 21
when 6
they 5
get 13
to 805
our 3
age 24
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
they 5
will 39
not 85
think 8
about 1
officers 1
any 17
more 11
than 22
we 444
do 814
i 4330
remember 4
the 193
time 45
when 6
i 4330
liked 1
a 6799
red 211
coat 12
myself 1
very 1
well 24
and 51
indeed 1
so 797
i 4330
do 814
still 13
at 272
my 90
heart 57
and 51
if 8
a 6799
smart 20
young 9
colonel 5
with 34
five 5
or 333
six 24
thousand 7
a 6799
year 19
should 7
want 13
one 19
of 109
my 90
girls 1
i 4330
shall 12
not 85
say 7
nay 6
to 805
him 9
and 51
i 4330
thought 11
colonel 5
forster 1
looked 1
very 1
becoming 2
the 193
other 5
night 61
at 272
sir 22
in 2719
his 43
mamma 9
cried 1
lydia 4
my 90
aunt 6
says 1
that 11
colonel 5
forster 1
and 51
captain 8
carter 3
do 814
not 85
go 500
so 797
often 4
to 805
miss 71
as 509
they 5
did 23
when 6
they 5
first 8
came 36
she 199
sees 6
them 9
now 10
very 1
often 4
standing 3
in 2719

library 2
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
prevented 1
replying 1
by 57
the 193
entrance 6
of 109
the 193
footman 2
with 34
a 6799
note 16
for 484
miss 71
bennet 1
it 67
came 36
from 2
and 51
the 193
servant 3
waited 1
for 484
an 970
answer 8
mrs 1
eyes 8
sparkled 1
with 34
pleasure 5
and 51
she 199
was 93
eagerly 1
calling 3
out 365
while 4
her 181
daughter 4
read 49
well 24
jane 8

aloud 1
my 90
dear 15

of 109

each 1
other 5
for 484
the 193
rest 110
of 109
our 3
lives 4

that 11

very 1
unlucky 1

i 4330
have 11
the 193
carriage 5
said 1
jane 8
no 896
my 90
dear 15
you 29
had 11
better 7
go 500
on 86
horseback 2
because 1
it 67
seems 1
likely 1
to 805
rain 31
and 51
then 5
you 29
must 28
stay 7
all 162
night 61
that 11
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
good 28
scheme 7
said 1
elizabeth 5
if 8
you 29
were 5
sure 11
that 11
they 5
would 5
not 85
offer 10
to 805
send 10
her 181
home 90
oh 17
but 82
the 193
gentlemen 1
will 39
have 11
mr 5
chaise 3
to 805
go 500
to 805
and 51
the 193
have 11
no 896
horses 7
to 805
theirs 1
i 4330
had 11
much 2
rather 2
go 500
in 2719
the 193
coach 11
but 82
my 90
dear 15
your 4
father 12
cannot 1
spare 11
the 193
horses 7
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
they 5
are 12
wanted 1
in 2719
the 193
farm 25
mr 5
bennet 1
are 12
they 5
not 85
they 5
are 12
wanted 1
in 2719
the 193
farm 25
much 2
oftener 1
than 22
i 4330
can 287
get 13
them 9
but 82
if 8
you 29
have 11
got 14
them 9
to 805
day 27
said 1
elizabeth 5
my 90
mother's 1
purpose 12
will 39
be 1200
answered 1
she 199
did 23
at 272
last 7
extort 14
from 2
her 181
father 12
an 970
acknowledgment 3
that 11
the 193
horses 7
were 5
engaged 1
jane 8
was 93
therefore 1
obliged 1
to 805
go 500
on 86
horseback 2
and 51
her 181
mother 21
attended 1
her 181
to 805
the 193
door 41
with 34
many 2
cheerful 6
prognostics 1
of 109
a 6799
bad 33
day 27
her 181
hopes 1
were 5
answered 1
jane 8
had 11
not 85
been 1
gone 4
long 49
before 2
it 67
rained 1
hard 70
her 181
sisters 1
were 5
uneasy 1
for 484
her 181
but 82
her 181
mother 21
was 93
delighted 2
the 193
rain 31
continued 1
the 193
whole 26
evening 3
without 1
intermission 3
jane 8
certainly 1
could 2
not 85
come 36
back 182
this 6
was 93
a 6799
lucky 1
idea 21
of 109
mine 26
indeed 1
said 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
more 11
than 22
once 2
as 509
if 8
the 193
credit 12
of 109
making 4
it 67
rain 31
were 5
all 162
her 181
own 9
till 14
the 193
next 2
morning 3
however 1
she 199
was 93
not 85
aware 3
of 109
all 162
the 193
felicity 2
of 109
her 181
contrivance 3
breakfast 5
was 93
scarcely 1
over 596
when 6
a 6799
servant 3
from 2
brought 1
the 193
following 3
note 16
for 484
elizabeth 5
my 90
dearest 2
lizzy 2
i 4330
find 10
myself 1
very 1
unwell 1
this 6
morning 3
which 2
i 4330
suppose 4
is 124
to 805
be 1200
imputed 1
to 805
my 90
getting 1
wet 19
through 4
yesterday 3
my 90
kind 31
friends 4
will 39
not 85
hear 76
of 109
my 90
returning 1
till 14
i 4330
am 392
better 7
they 5
insist 9
also 3
on 86
my 90
seeing 2
mr 5
jones 1
therefore 1
do 814
not 85
be 1200
alarmed 1
if 8
you 29
should 7
hear 76
of 109
his 43
having 1
been 1
to 805
me 1041
and 51
excepting 1
a 6799
sore 11
throat 9
and 51
headache 3
there 21
is 124
not 85
much 2
the 193
matter 7
with 34
me 1041
yours 3
etc 10
well 24
my 90
dear 15
said 1
mr 5
bennet 1
when 6
elizabeth 5
had 11
read 49
the 193
note 16
aloud 1
if 8
your 4
daughter 4
should 7
have 11
a 6799
dangerous 2
fit 28
of 109
illness 3
if 8
she 199
should 7
die 38
it 67
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
comfort 14
to 805
know 12
that 11
it 67
was 93
all 162
in 2719
pursuit 3
of 109
mr 5
and 51
under 288
your 4
orders 1
oh 17
i 4330
am 392
not 85
afraid 1
of 109
her 181
dying 2
people 4
do 814
not 85
die 38
of 109
little 6
trifling 1
colds 1
she 199
will 39
be 1200
taken 1
good 28
care 47
of 109
as 509
long 49
as 509
she 199
stays 1
there 21
it 67
is 124
all 162
very 1
well 24
i 4330
would 5
go 500
and 51
see 70
her 181
if 8
i 4330
could 2
have 11
the 193
carriage 5
elizabeth 5
feeling 4
really 1
anxious 4
was 93
determined 2
to 805
go 500
to 805
her 181
though 12
the 193
carriage 5
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1200
had 11
and 51
as 509
she 199
was 93
no 896
horsewoman 2
walking 2
was 93
her 181
only 1
alternative 4
she 199
declared 1
her 181
resolution 3
how 27
can 287
you 29
be 1200
so 797
silly 2
cried 1
her 181
mother 21
as 509
to 805
think 8
of 109
such 2
a 6799
thing 15
in 2719
all 162
this 6
dirt 13
you 29
will 39
not 85
be 1200
fit 28
to 805
be 1200
seen 1
when 6
you 29
get 13
there 21
i 4330
shall 12
be 1200
very 1
fit 28
to 805
see 70
jane 8
which 2
is 124
all 162
i 4330
want 13
is 124
this 6
a 6799
hint 13
to 805
me 1041
lizzy 2
said 1
her 181
father 12
to 805
send 10
for 484
the 193
horses 7
no 896
indeed 1
i 4330
do 814
not 85
wish 13
to 805
avoid 8
the 193
walk 25
the 193
distance 4
is 124
nothing 5
when 6
one 19
has 41
a 6799
motive 4
only 1
three 12
miles 4
i 4330
shall 12
be 1200
back 182
by 57
dinner 9
i 4330
admire 6
the 193
activity 2
of 109
your 4
benevolence 3
observed 1
mary 13
but 82
every 10
impulse 4
of 109
feeling 4
should 7
be 1200
guided 1
by 57
reason 13
and 51
in 2719
my 90
opinion 4
exertion 3
should 7
always 1
be 1200
in 2719
proportion 11
to 805
what 14
is 124
required 1
we 444
will 39
go 500
as 509
far 91
as 509
with 34
you 29
said 1
catherine 2
and 51
lydia 4
elizabeth 5
accepted 1
their 2
company 2
and 51
the 193
three 12
young 9
ladies 1
set 40
off 100
together 3
if 8
we 444
make 17
haste 8
said 1
lydia 4
as 509
they 5
walked 1
along 3
perhaps 1
we 444
may 49
see 70
something 3
of 109
captain 8
carter 3
before 2
he 962
goes 1
in 2719
they 5
parted 1
the 193
two 14
youngest 1
repaired 1
to 805
the 193
lodgings 2
of 109
one 19
of 109
the 193
wives 1
and 51
elizabeth 5
continued 1
her 181
walk 25
alone 1
crossing 3
field 15
after 48
field 15
at 272
a 6799
quick 25
pace 14
jumping 1
over 596
stiles 1
and 51
springing 1
over 596
puddles 1
with 34
impatient 2
activity 2
and 51
finding 4
herself 1
at 272
last 7
within 3
view 18
of 109
the 193
house 87
with 34
weary 2
ankles 1
dirty 2
stockings 1
and 51
a 6799
face 19
glowing 2
with 34
the 193
warmth 2
of 109
exercise 7
she 199
was 93
shown 1
into 26
the 193
breakfast 5
where 21
all 162
but 82
jane 8
were 5
assembled 1
and 51
where 21
her 181
appearance 3
created 1
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
surprise 4
that 11
she 199
should 7
have 11
walked 1
three 12
miles 4
so 797
early 1
in 2719
the 193
day 27
in 2719
such 2
dirty 2
weather 33
and 51
by 57
herself 1
was 93
almost 1
incredible 1
to 805
mrs 1
hurst 2
and 51
miss 71
and 51
elizabeth 5
was 93
convinced 1
that 11
they 5
held 1
her 181
in 2719
contempt 8
for 484
it 67
she 199
was 93
received 1
however 1
very 1
politely 1
by 57
them 9
and 51
in 2719
their 2
brother's 1
manners 1
there 21
was 93
something 3
better 7
than 22
politeness 2
there 21
was 93
good 28
and 51
kindness 3
mr 5
darcy 2
said 1
very 1
little 6
and 51
mr 5
hurst 2
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
the 193
former 3
was 93
divided 1
between 1
admiration 2
of 109
the 193
brilliancy 2
which 2
exercise 7
had 11
given 3
to 805
her 181
complexion 5
and 51
doubt 15
as 509
to 805
the 193
occasion's 1
justifying 1
her 181
coming 3
so 797
far 91
alone 1
the 193
latter 3
was 93
thinking 2
only 1
of 109
his 43
breakfast 5
her 181
inquiries 1
after 48
her 181
sister 9
were 5
not 85
very 1
answered 1
miss 71
bennet 1
had 11
slept 1
ill 84
and 51
though 12
up 194
was 93
very 1
feverish 4
and 51
not 85
well 24
enough 2
to 805
leave 14
her 181
room 22
elizabeth 5
was 93
glad 30
to 805
be 1200
taken 1
to 805
her 181
immediately 1
and 51
jane 8
who 79
had 11
only 1
been 1
withheld 1
by 57
the 193
fear 14
of 109
giving 2
alarm 9
or 333
inconvenience 4
from 2
expressing 1
in 2719
her 181
note 16
how 27
much 2
she 199
longed 1
for 484
such 2
a 6799
visit 14
was 93
delighted 2
at 272
her 181
entrance 6
she 199
was 93
not 85
equal 17
however 1
to 805
much 2
conversation 8
and 51
when 6
miss 71
left 19
them 9
together 3
could 2
attempt 5
little 6
besides 1
expressions 1
of 109
gratitude 2
for 484
the 193
extraordinary 1
kindness 3
she 199
was 93
treated 1
with 34
elizabeth 5
silently 1
attended 1
her 181
when 6
breakfast 5
was 93
over 596
they 5
were 5
joined 1
by 57
the 193
sisters 1
and 51
elizabeth 5
began 1
to 805
like 22
them 9
herself 1
when 6
she 199
saw 24
how 27
much 2
affection 5
and 51
solicitude 2
they 5
showed 1
for 484
jane 8
the 193
apothecary 2
came 36
and 51
having 1
examined 1
his 43
patient 6
said 1
as 509
might 9
be 1200
supposed 2
that 11
she 199
had 11
caught 1
a 6799
violent 2
cold 9
and 51
that 11
they 5
must 28
to 805
get 13
the 193
better 7
of 109
it 67
advised 2
her 181
to 805
return 14
to 805
bed 93
and 51
promised 1
her 181
some 30
the 193
advice 2
was 93
followed 1
readily 1
for 484
the 193
feverish 4
symptoms 1
increased 1
and 51
her 181
head 140
ached 1
acutely 1
elizabeth 5
did 23
not 85
quit 14
her 181
room 22
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
nor 102
were 5
the 193
other 5
ladies 1
often 4
absent 14
the 193
gentlemen 1
being 3
out 365
they 5
had 11
in 2719
fact 35
nothing 5
to 805
do 814
elsewhere 1
when 6
the 193
clock 9
struck 1
three 12
elizabeth 5
felt 5
that 11
she 199
must 28
go 500
and 51
very 1
unwillingly 1
said 1
so 797
miss 71
offered 1
her 181
the 193
carriage 5
and 51
she 199
only 1
wanted 1
a 6799
little 6
pressing 4
to 805
accept 16
it 67
when 6
jane 8
testified 1
such 2
concern 6
in 2719
parting 3
with 34
her 181
that 11
miss 71
was 93
obliged 1
to 805
convert 13
the 193
offer 10
of 109
the 193
chaise 3
to 805
an 970
invitation 6
to 805
remain 9
at 272
for 484
the 193
present 20
elizabeth 5
most 3
thankfully 1
consented 1
and 51
a 6799
servant 3
was 93
dispatched 1
to 805
to 805
acquaint 9
the 193
family 2
with 34
her 181
stay 7
and 51
bring 6
back 182
a 6799
supply 3
of 109
clothes 10
chapter 3
at 272
five 5
o'clock 1
the 193
two 14
ladies 1
retired 1
to 805
dress 22
and 51
at 272
half 23
past 71
six 24
elizabeth 5
was 93
summoned 1
to 805
dinner 9
to 805
the 193
civil 15
inquiries 1
which 2
then 5
poured 1
in 2719
and 51
which 2
she 199
had 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
distinguishing 1
the 193
much 2
superior 5
solicitude 2
of 109
mr 5
she 199
could 2
not 85
make 17
a 6799
very 1
answer 8
jane 8
was 93
by 57
no 896
means 1
better 7
the 193
sisters 1
on 86
hearing 3
this 6
repeated 2
three 12
or 333
four 26
times 10
how 27
much 2
they 5
were 5
grieved 1
how 27
shocking 2
it 67
was 93
to 805
have 11
a 6799
bad 33
cold 9
and 51
how 27
excessively 1
they 5
disliked 1
being 3
ill 84
themselves 1
and 51
then 5
thought 11
no 896
more 11
of 109
the 193
matter 7
and 51
their 2
indifference 2
towards 1
jane 8
when 6
not 85
immediately 1
before 2
them 9
restored 1
elizabeth 5
to 805
the 193
enjoyment 3
of 109
all 162
her 181
former 3
dislike 4
their 2
brother 9
indeed 1
was 93
the 193
only 1
one 19
of 109
the 193
party 3
whom 3
she 199
could 2
regard 7
with 34
any 17
complacency 2
his 43
anxiety 2
for 484
jane 8
was 93
evident 2
and 51
his 43
attentions 1
to 805
herself 1
most 3
pleasing 3
and 51
they 5
prevented 1
her 181
feeling 4
herself 1
so 797
much 2
an 970
intruder 3
as 509
she 199
believed 1
she 199
was 93
considered 1
by 57
the 193
others 1
she 199
had 11
very 1
little 6
notice 8
from 2
any 17
but 82
him 9
miss 71
was 93
engrossed 1
by 57
mr 5
darcy 2
her 181
sister 9
scarcely 1
less 19
so 797
and 51
as 509
for 484
mr 5
hurst 2
by 57
whom 3
elizabeth 5
sat 92
he 962
was 93
an 970
indolent 2
man 342
who 79
lived 1
only 1
to 805
eat 15
drink 9
and 51
play 73
at 272
cards 7
who 79
when 6
he 962
found 18
her 181
to 805
prefer 13
a 6799
plain 27
dish 52
to 805
a 6799
ragout 3
had 11
nothing 5
to 805
say 7
to 805
her 181
when 6
dinner 9
was 93
over 596
she 199
returned 1
directly 1
to 805
jane 8
and 51
miss 71
began 1
abusing 1
her 181
as 509
soon 3
as 509
she 199
was 93
out 365
of 109
the 193
room 22
her 181
manners 1
were 5
pronounced 1
to 805
be 1200
very 1
bad 33
indeed 1
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109
pride 6
and 51
impertinence 3
she 199
had 11
no 896
conversation 8
no 896
style 4
no 896
beauty 2
mrs 1
hurst 2
thought 11
the 193
same 5
and 51
added 1
she 199
has 41
nothing 5
in 2719
short 62
to 805
recommend 8
her 181
but 82
being 3
an 970
excellent 2
walker 3
i 4330
shall 12
never 3
forget 8
her 181
appearance 3
this 6
morning 3
she 199
really 1
looked 1
almost 1
wild 36
she 199
did 23
indeed 1
louisa 2
i 4330
could 2
hardly 1
keep 11
my 90
countenance 4
very 1
nonsensical 2
to 805
come 36
at 272
all 162
why 4
must 28
she 199
be 1200
scampering 1
about 1
the 193
country 12
because 1
her 181
sister 9
had 11
a 6799
cold 9
her 181
hair 71
so 797
untidy 1
so 797
yes 16
and 51
her 181
petticoat 3
i 4330
hope 16
you 29
saw 24
her 181
petticoat 3
six 24
inches 1
deep 12
in 2719
mud 38
i 4330
am 392
absolutely 1
certain 5
and 51
the 193
gown 5
which 2
had 11
been 1
let 50
down 90
to 805
hide 18
it 67
not 85
doing 3
its 2
office 11
your 4
picture 8
may 49
be 1200
very 1
exact 14
louisa 2
said 1
but 82
this 6
was 93
all 162
lost 1
upon 1
me 1041
i 4330
thought 11
miss 71
elizabeth 5
bennet 1
looked 1
remarkably 1
well 24
when 6
she 199
came 36
into 26
the 193
room 22
this 6
morning 3
her 181
dirty 2
petticoat 3
quite 1
escaped 1
my 90
notice 8
you 29
observed 1
it 67
mr 5
darcy 2
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
said 1
miss 71
and 51
i 4330
am 392
inclined 1
to 805
think 8
that 11
you 29
would 5
not 85
wish 13
to 805
see 70
your 4
sister 9
make 17
such 2
an 970
exhibition 8
certainly 1
not 85
to 805
walk 25
three 12
miles 4
or 333
four 26
miles 4
or 333
five 5
miles 4
or 333
whatever 1
it 67
is 124
above 3
her 181
ankles 1
in 2719
dirt 13
and 51
alone 1
quite 1
alone 1
what 14
could 2
she 199
mean 36
by 57
it 67
it 67
seems 1
to 805
me 1041
to 805
show 64
an 970
abominable 1
sort 14
of 109
conceited 4
independence 2
a 6799
most 3
country 12
town 27
indifference 2
to 805
decorum 2
it 67
shows 5
an 970
affection 5
for 484
her 181
sister 9
that 11
is 124
very 1
pleasing 3
said 1
i 4330
am 392
afraid 1
mr 5
darcy 2
observed 1
miss 71
in 2719
a 6799
half 23
whisper 8
that 11
this 6
adventure 11
has 41
rather 2
affected 2
your 4
admiration 2
of 109
her 181
fine 17
eyes 8
not 85
at 272
all 162
he 962
replied 1
they 5
were 5
brightened 1
by 57
the 193
exercise 7
a 6799
short 62
pause 4
followed 1
this 6
speech 13
and 51
mrs 1
hurst 2
began 1
again 2
i 4330
have 11
an 970
excessive 2
regard 7
for 484
miss 71
jane 8
bennet 1
she 199
is 124
really 1
a 6799
very 1
sweet 33
girl 14
and 51
i 4330
wish 13
with 34
all 162
my 90
heart 57
she 199
were 5
well 24
settled 1
but 82
with 34
such 2
a 6799
father 12
and 51
mother 21
and 51
such 2
low 46
connections 1
i 4330
am 392
afraid 1
there 21
is 124
no 896
chance 20
of 109
it 67
i 4330
think 8
i 4330
have 11
heard 1
you 29
say 7
that 11
their 2
uncle 18
is 124
an 970
attorney 3
in 2719
yes 16
and 51
they 5
have 11
another 1
who 79
lives 4
somewhere 1
near 15
that 11
is 124
capital 17
added 1
her 181
sister 9
and 51
they 5
both 8
laughed 1
heartily 1
if 8
they 5
had 11
uncles 1
enough 2
to 805
fill 25
all 162
cried 1
it 67
would 5
not 85
make 17
them 9
one 19
jot 10
less 19
agreeable 3
but 82
it 67
must 28
very 1
materially 1
lessen 4
their 2
chance 20
of 109
marrying 1
men 140
of 109
any 17
consideration 3
in 2719
the 193
world 12
replied 1
darcy 2
to 805
this 6
speech 13
made 13
no 896
answer 8
but 82
his 43
sisters 1
gave 4
it 67
their 2
hearty 2
assent 5
and 51
indulged 1
their 2
mirth 8
for 484
some 30
time 45
at 272
the 193
expense 3
of 109
their 2
dear 15
friend's 1
vulgar 22
relations 4
with 34
a 6799
renewal 3
of 109
tenderness 2
however 1
they 5
returned 1
to 805
her 181
room 22
on 86
leaving 3
the 193
dining 1
and 51
sat 92
with 34
her 181
till 14
summoned 1
to 805
coffee 15
she 199
was 93
still 13
very 1
poorly 1
and 51
elizabeth 5
would 5
not 85
quit 14
her 181
at 272
all 162
till 14
late 23
in 2719
the 193
evening 3
when 6
she 199
had 11
the 193
comfort 14
of 109
seeing 2
her 181
sleep 33
and 51
when 6
it 67
seemed 1
to 805
her 181
rather 2
right 31
than 22
pleasant 9
that 11
she 199
should 7
go 500
downstairs 2
herself 1
on 86
entering 1
the 193
drawing 3
room 22
she 199
found 18
the 193
whole 26
party 3
at 272
loo 65
and 51
was 93
immediately 1
invited 1
to 805
join 16
them 9
but 82
suspecting 1
them 9
to 805
be 1200
playing 1
high 54
she 199
declined 1
it 67
and 51
making 4
her 181
sister 9
the 193
excuse 4
said 1
she 199
would 5
amuse 6
herself 1
for 484
the 193
short 62
time 45
she 199
could 2
stay 7
below 1
with 34
a 6799
book 69
mr 5
hurst 2
looked 1
at 272
her 181
with 34
astonishment 2
do 814
you 29
prefer 13
reading 3
to 805
cards 7
said 1
he 962
that 11
is 124
rather 2
singular 7
miss 71
eliza 7
bennet 1
said 1
miss 71
despises 1
cards 7
she 199
is 124
a 6799
great 12
reader 6
and 51
has 41
no 896
pleasure 5
in 2719
anything 3
else 2
i 4330
deserve 4
neither 1
such 2
praise 7
nor 102
such 2
censure 7
cried 1
elizabeth 5
i 4330
am 392
not 85
a 6799
great 12
reader 6
and 51
i 4330
have 11
pleasure 5
in 2719
many 2
things 1
in 2719
nursing 2
your 4
sister 9
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
have 11
pleasure 5
said 1
and 51
i 4330
hope 16
it 67
will 39
be 1200
soon 3
increased 1
by 57
seeing 2
her 181
quite 1
well 24
elizabeth 5
thanked 1
him 9
from 2
her 181
heart 57
and 51
then 5
walked 1
towards 1
the 193
table 27
where 21
a 6799
few 6
books 15
were 5
lying 2
he 962
immediately 1
offered 1
to 805
fetch 8
her 181
others 1
all 162
that 11
his 43
library 2
afforded 1
and 51
i 4330
wish 13
my 90
collection 3
were 5
larger 1
for 484
your 4
benefit 5
and 51
my 90
own 9
credit 12
but 82
i 4330
am 392
an 970
idle 10
fellow 9
and 51
though 12
i 4330
have 11
not 85
many 2
i 4330
have 11
more 11
than 22
i 4330
ever 33
looked 1
into 26
elizabeth 5
assured 4
him 9
that 11
she 199
could 2
suit 21
herself 1
perfectly 1
with 34
those 1
in 2719
the 193
room 22
i 4330
am 392
astonished 1
said 1
miss 71
that 11
my 90
father 12
should 7
have 11
left 19
so 797
small 14
a 6799
collection 3
of 109
books 15
what 14
a 6799
delightful 2
library 2
you 29
have 11
at 272
mr 5
darcy 2
it 67
ought 2
to 805
be 1200
good 28
he 962
replied 1
it 67
has 41
been 1
the 193
work 87
of 109
many 2
generations 1
and 51
then 5
you 29
have 11
added 1
so 797
much 2
to 805
it 67
yourself 1
you 29
are 12
always 1
buying 1
books 15
i 4330
cannot 1
comprehend 4
the 193
neglect 9
of 109
a 6799
family 2
library 2
in 2719
such 2
days 1
as 509
these 4
neglect 9
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
neglect 9
nothing 5
that 11
can 287
add 54
to 805
the 193
beauties 1
of 109
that 11
noble 13
place 29
charles 5
when 6
you 29
build 12
your 4
house 87
i 4330
wish 13
it 67
may 49
be 1200
half 23
as 509
delightful 2
as 509
i 4330
wish 13
it 67
may 49
but 82
i 4330
would 5
really 1
advise 9
you 29
to 805
make 17
your 4
purchase 7
in 2719
that 11
and 51
take 18
for 484
a 6799
kind 31
of 109
model 10
there 21
is 124
not 85
a 6799
finer 3
county 3
in 2719
england 2
than 22
with 34
all 162
my 90
heart 57
i 4330
will 39
buy 13
itself 1
if 8
darcy 2
will 39
sell 15
it 67
i 4330
am 392
talking 1
of 109
possibilities 1
charles 5
upon 1
my 90
word 26
caroline 1
i 4330
should 7
think 8
it 67
more 11
possible 3
to 805
get 13
by 57
purchase 7
than 22
by 57
imitation 3
elizabeth 5
was 93
so 797
much 2
caught 1
with 34
what 14
passed 1
as 509
to 805
leave 14
her 181
very 1
little 6
attention 3
for 484
her 181
book 69
and 51
soon 3
laying 1
it 67
wholly 1
aside 3
she 199
drew 2
near 15
the 193
card 54
table 27
and 51
stationed 1
herself 1
between 1
mr 5
and 51
his 43
eldest 1
sister 9
to 805
observe 6
the 193
game 24
is 124
miss 71
darcy 2
much 2
grown 4
since 7
the 193
spring 23
said 1
miss 71

now 10
about 1
miss 71
elizabeth 5
height 7
or 333
rather 2
taller 1
how 27
i 4330
long 49
to 805
see 70
her 181
again 2
i 4330
never 3
met 180
with 34
anybody 2
who 79
delighted 2
me 1041
so 797
much 2
such 2
a 6799
countenance 4
such 2
manners 1
and 51
so 797
extremely 1
accomplished 1
for 484
her 181
age 24
her 181
performance 3
on 86
the 193
pianoforte 3
is 124
exquisite 4
it 67
is 124
amazing 2
to 805
me 1041
said 1
how 27
young 9
ladies 1
can 287
have 11
patience 2
to 805
be 1200
so 797
very 1
accomplished 1
as 509
they 5
all 162
are 12
all 162
young 9
ladies 1
accomplished 1
my 90
dear 15
charles 5
what 14
do 814
you 29
mean 36
yes 16
all 162
of 109
them 9
i 4330
think 8
they 5
all 162
paint 19
tables 7
cover 21
screens 1
and 51
net 39
purses 1
i 4330
scarcely 1
know 12
anyone 2
who 79
cannot 1
do 814
all 162
this 6
and 51
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
i 4330
never 3
heard 1
a 6799
young 9
lady 18
spoken 1
of 109
for 484
the 193
first 8
time 45
without 1
being 3
informed 1
that 11
she 199
was 93
very 1
accomplished 1
your 4
list 27
of 109
the 193
common 23
extent 3
of 109
accomplishments 1
said 1
darcy 2
has 41
too 50
much 2
truth 7
the 193
word 26
is 124
applied 1
to 805
many 2
a 6799
woman 21
who 79
deserves 1
it 67
no 896
otherwise 1
than 22
by 57
netting 2
a 6799
purse 7
or 333
covering 3
a 6799
screen 15
but 82
i 4330
am 392
very 1
far 91
from 2
agreeing 1
with 34
you 29
in 2719
your 4
estimation 3
of 109
ladies 1
in 2719
general 22
i 4330
cannot 1
boast 12
of 109
knowing 3
more 11
than 22
half 23
a 6799
dozen 4
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
range 9
of 109
my 90
acquaintance 5
that 11
are 12
really 1
accomplished 1
nor 102
i 4330
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
said 1
miss 71
then 5
observed 1
elizabeth 5
you 29
must 28
comprehend 4
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
in 2719
your 4
idea 21
of 109
an 970
accomplished 1
woman 21
yes 16
i 4330
do 814
comprehend 4
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
in 2719
it 67
oh 17
certainly 1
cried 1
his 43
faithful 6
assistant 3
no 896
one 19
can 287
be 1200
really 1
esteemed 1
accomplished 1
who 79
does 5
not 85
greatly 1
surpass 4
what 14
is 124
usually 1
met 180
with 34
a 6799
woman 21
must 28
have 11
a 6799
thorough 13
knowledge 4
of 109
music 24
singing 2
drawing 3
dancing 2
and 51
the 193
modern 23
languages 1
to 805
deserve 4
the 193
word 26
and 51
besides 1
all 162
this 6
she 199
must 28
possess 16
a 6799
certain 5
something 3
in 2719
her 181
air 129
and 51
manner 8
of 109
walking 2
the 193
tone 12
of 109
her 181
voice 8
her 181
address 9
and 51
expressions 1
or 333
the 193
word 26
will 39
be 1200
but 82
half 23
deserved 2
all 162
this 6
she 199
must 28
possess 16
added 1
darcy 2
and 51
to 805
all 162
this 6
she 199
must 28
yet 4
add 54
something 3
more 11
substantial 2
in 2719
the 193
improvement 3
of 109
her 181
mind 25
by 57
extensive 4
reading 3
i 4330
am 392
no 896
longer 1
surprised 1
at 272
your 4
knowing 3
only 1
six 24
accomplished 1
women 5
i 4330
rather 2
wonder 17
now 10
at 272
your 4
knowing 3
any 17
are 12
you 29
so 797
severe 7
upon 1
your 4
own 9
sex 45
as 509
to 805
doubt 15
the 193
possibility 2
of 109
all 162
this 6
i 4330
never 3
saw 24
such 2
a 6799
woman 21
i 4330
never 3
saw 24
such 2
capacity 2
and 51
taste 15
and 51
application 3
and 51
elegance 2
as 509
you 29
describe 6
united 2
mrs 1
hurst 2
and 51
miss 71
both 8
cried 1
out 365
against 1
the 193
injustice 3
of 109
her 181
implied 1
doubt 15
and 51
were 5
both 8
protesting 1
that 11
they 5
knew 1
many 2
women 5
who 79
answered 1
this 6
description 3
when 6
mr 5
hurst 2
called 1
them 9
to 805
order 11
with 34
bitter 15
complaints 1
of 109
their 2
inattention 2
to 805
what 14
was 93
going 3
forward 12
as 509
all 162
conversation 8
was 93
thereby 1
at 272
an 970
end 92
elizabeth 5
soon 3
afterwards 1
left 19
the 193
room 22
elizabeth 5
bennet 1
said 1
miss 71
when 6
the 193
door 41
was 93
closed 1
on 86
her 181
is 124
one 19
of 109
those 1
young 9
ladies 1
who 79
seek 6
to 805
recommend 8
themselves 1
to 805
the 193
other 5
sex 45
by 57
undervaluing 1
their 2
own 9
and 51
with 34
many 2
men 140
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
it 67
succeeds 1
but 82
in 2719
my 90
opinion 4
it 67
is 124
a 6799
paltry 1
device 3
a 6799
very 1
mean 36
art 104
undoubtedly 1
replied 1
darcy 2
to 805
whom 3
this 6
remark 9
was 93
chiefly 1
addressed 1
there 21
is 124
a 6799
meanness 2
in 2719
all 162
the 193
arts 4
which 2
ladies 1
sometimes 1
condescend 5
to 805
employ 15
for 484
captivation 2
whatever 1
bears 4
affinity 2
to 805
cunning 7
is 124
despicable 1
miss 71
was 93
not 85
so 797
entirely 1
satisfied 1
with 34
this 6
reply 3
as 509
to 805
continue 3
the 193
subject 11
elizabeth 5
joined 1
them 9
again 2
only 1
to 805
say 7
that 11
her 181
sister 9
was 93
worse 6
and 51
that 11
she 199
could 2
not 85
leave 14
her 181
urged 1
mr 5
jones 1
being 3
sent 35
for 484
immediately 1
while 4
his 43
sisters 1
convinced 1
that 11
no 896
country 12
advice 2
could 2
be 1200
of 109
any 17
service 13
recommended 1
an 970
express 25
to 805
town 27
for 484
one 19
of 109
the 193
most 3
eminent 2
physicians 1
this 6
she 199
would 5
not 85
hear 76
of 109
but 82
she 199
was 93
not 85
so 797
unwilling 4
to 805
comply 2
with 34
their 2
brother's 1
proposal 3
and 51
it 67
was 93
settled 1
that 11
mr 5
jones 1
should 7
be 1200
sent 35
for 484
early 1
in 2719
the 193
morning 3
if 8
miss 71
bennet 1
were 5
not 85
decidedly 1
better 7
was 93
quite 1
uncomfortable 1
his 43
sisters 1
declared 1
that 11
they 5
were 5
miserable 3
they 5
solaced 1
their 2
wretchedness 2
however 1
by 57
duets 1
after 48
supper 4
while 4
he 962
could 2
find 10
no 896
better 7
relief 3
to 805
his 43
feelings 1
than 22
by 57
giving 2
his 43
housekeeper 3
directions 1
that 11
every 10
attention 3
might 9
be 1200
paid 1
to 805
the 193
sick 38
lady 18
and 51

sister 9
chapter 3
elizabeth 5
passed 1
the 193
chief 14
of 109
the 193
night 61
in 2719
her 181
sister's 1
room 22
and 51
in 2719
the 193
morning 3
had 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
being 3
able 3
to 805
send 10
a 6799
tolerable 1
answer 8
to 805
the 193
inquiries 1
which 2
she 199
very 1
early 1
received 1
from 2
mr 5
by 57
a 6799
housemaid 3
and 51
some 30
time 45
afterwards 1
from 2
the 193
two 14
elegant 2
ladies 1
who 79
waited 1
on 86
his 43
sisters 1
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
this 6
amendment 3
however 1
she 199
requested 1
to 805
have 11
a 6799
note 16
sent 35
to 805
desiring 1
her 181
mother 21
to 805
visit 14
jane 8
and 51
form 68
her 181
own 9
of 109
her 181
situation 3
the 193
note 16
was 93
immediately 1
dispatched 1
and 51
its 2
contents 1
as 509
quickly 1
complied 1
with 34
mrs 1
bennet 1
accompanied 1
by 57
her 181
two 14
youngest 1
girls 1
reached 1
soon 3
after 48
the 193
family 2
breakfast 5
had 11
she 199
found 18
jane 8
in 2719
any 17
apparent 2
danger 7
mrs 1
bennet 1
would 5
have 11
been 1
very 1
miserable 3
but 82
being 3
satisfied 1
on 86
seeing 2
her 181
that 11
her 181
illness 3
was 93
not 85
alarming 2
she 199
had 11
no 896
wish 13
of 109
her 181
recovering 1
immediately 1
as 509
her 181
restoration 3
to 805
health 12
would 5
probably 1
remove 7
her 181
from 2
she 199
would 5
not 85
listen 9
therefore 1
to 805
her 181
daughter's 1
proposal 3
of 109
being 3
carried 1
home 90
neither 1
did 23
the 193
apothecary 2
who 79
arrived 1
about 1
the 193
same 5
time 45
think 8
it 67
at 272
all 162
advisable 1
after 48
sitting 3
a 6799
little 6
while 4
with 34
jane 8

miss 71
appearance 3
and 51
invitation 6
the 193
mother 21
and 51
three 12
daughters 1
all 162
attended 1
her 181
into 26
the 193
breakfast 5
met 180
them 9
with 34
hopes 1
that 11
mrs 1
bennet 1
had 11
not 85
found 18
miss 71
bennet 1
worse 6
than 22
she 199
expected 1
indeed 1
i 4330
have 11
sir 22
was 93
her 181
answer 8
she 199
is 124
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
too 50
ill 84
to 805
be 1200
moved 1
mr 5
jones 1
says 1
we 444
must 28
not 85
think 8
of 109
moving 2
her 181
we 444
must 28
trespass 8
a 6799
little 6
longer 1
on 86
your 4
kindness 3
removed 1
cried 1
it 67
must 28
not 85
be 1200
thought 11
of 109
my 90
sister 9
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
will 39
not 85
hear 76
of 109
her 181
removal 3
you 29
may 49
depend 17
upon 1
it 67
madam 5
said 1
miss 71
with 34
cold 9
civility 2
that 11
miss 71
bennet 1
will 39
receive 8
every 10
possible 3
attention 3
while 4
she 199
remains 1
with 34
us 70
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
profuse 4
in 2719
her 181
acknowledgments 1
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
she 199
added 1
if 8
it 67
was 93
not 85
for 484
such 2
good 28
friends 4
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
what 14
would 5
become 2
of 109
her 181
for 484
she 199
is 124
very 1
ill 84
indeed 1
and 51
suffers 1
a 6799
vast 8
deal 13
though 12
with 34
the 193
greatest 1
patience 2
in 2719
the 193
world 12
which 2
is 124
always 1
the 193
way 27
with 34
her 181
for 484
she 199
has 41
without 1
exception 6
the 193
sweetest 1
temper 22
i 4330
have 11
ever 33
met 180
with 34
i 4330
often 4
tell 16
my 90
other 5
girls 1
they 5
are 12
nothing 5
to 805
her 181
you 29
have 11
a 6799
sweet 33
room 22
here 31
mr 5
and 51
a 6799
charming 2
prospect 13
over 596
the 193
gravel 7
walk 25
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
a 6799
place 29
in 2719
the 193
country 12
that 11
is 124
equal 17
to 805
you 29
will 39
not 85
think 8
of 109
quitting 1
it 67
in 2719
a 6799
hurry 3
i 4330
hope 16
though 12
you 29
have 11
but 82
a 6799
short 62
lease 16
whatever 1
i 4330
do 814
is 124
done 3
in 2719
a 6799
hurry 3
replied 1
he 962
and 51
therefore 1
if 8
i 4330
should 7
resolve 5
to 805
quit 14
i 4330
should 7
probably 1
be 1200
off 100
in 2719
five 5
minutes 2
at 272
present 20
however 1
i 4330
consider 13
myself 1
as 509
quite 1
fixed 2
here 31
that 11
is 124
exactly 1
what 14
i 4330
should 7
have 11
supposed 2
of 109
you 29
said 1
elizabeth 5
you 29
begin 8
to 805
comprehend 4
me 1041
do 814
you 29
cried 1
he 962
turning 3
towards 1
her 181
oh 17
yes 16
i 4330
understand 8
you 29
perfectly 1
i 4330
wish 13
i 4330
might 9
take 18
this 6
for 484
a 6799
compliment 6
but 82
to 805
be 1200
so 797
easily 1
seen 1
through 4
i 4330
am 392
afraid 1
is 124
pitiful 2
that 11
is 124
as 509
it 67
happens 4
it 67
does 5
not 85
follow 11
that 11
a 6799
deep 12
intricate 2
character 16
is 124
more 11
or 333
less 19
estimable 1
than 22
such 2
a 6799
one 19
as 509
yours 3
lizzy 2
cried 1
her 181
mother 21
remember 4
where 21
you 29
are 12
and 51
do 814
not 85
run 50
on 86
in 2719
the 193
wild 36
manner 8
that 11
you 29
are 12
suffered 1
to 805
do 814
at 272
home 90
i 4330
did 23
not 85
know 12
before 2
continued 1
immediately 1
that 11
you 29
were 5
a 6799
of 109
character 16
it 67
must 28
be 1200
an 970
amusing 2
study 3
yes 16
but 82
intricate 2
characters 1
are 12
the 193
most 3
amusing 2
they 5
have 11
at 272
least 3
that 11
advantage 6
the 193
country 12
said 1
darcy 2
can 287
in 2719
general 22
supply 3
but 82
a 6799
few 6
subjects 1
for 484
such 2
a 6799
study 3
in 2719
a 6799
country 12
you 29
move 10
in 2719
a 6799
very 1
confined 1
and 51
unvarying 1
society 2
but 82
people 4
themselves 1
alter 27
so 797
much 2
that 11
there 21
is 124
something 3
new 115
to 805
be 1200
observed 1
in 2719
them 9
for 484
ever 33
yes 16
indeed 1
cried 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
offended 1
by 57
his 43
manner 8
of 109
mentioning 1
a 6799
country 12
i 4330
assure 6
you 29
there 21
is 124
quite 1
as 509
much 2
of 109
that 11
going 3
on 86
in 2719
the 193
country 12
as 509
in 2719
town 27
everybody 2
was 93
surprised 1
and 51
darcy 2
after 48
looking 1
at 272
her 181
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
turned 1
silently 1
away 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
who 79
fancied 1
she 199
had 11
gained 1
a 6799
complete 8
victory 2
over 596
him 9
continued 1
her 181
triumph 10
i 4330
cannot 1
see 70
that 11
london 5
has 41
any 17
great 12
advantage 6
over 596
the 193
country 12
for 484
my 90
part 102
except 10
the 193
shops 1
and 51
public 18
places 1
the 193
country 12
is 124
a 6799
vast 8
deal 13
pleasanter 1
is 124
it 67
not 85
mr 5
when 6
i 4330
am 392
in 2719
the 193
country 12
he 962
replied 1
i 4330
never 3
wish 13
to 805
leave 14
it 67
and 51
when 6
i 4330
am 392
in 2719
town 27
it 67
is 124
pretty 3
much 2
the 193
same 5
they 5
have 11
each 1
their 2
advantages 1
and 51
i 4330
can 287
be 1200
equally 1
happy 1
in 2719
either 1
aye 4
that 11
is 124
because 1
you 29
have 11
the 193
right 31
disposition 3
but 82
that 11
gentleman 3
looking 1
at 272
darcy 2
seemed 1
to 805
think 8
the 193
country 12
was 93
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
indeed 1
mamma 9
you 29
are 12
mistaken 2
said 1
elizabeth 5
blushing 1
for 484
her 181
mother 21
you 29
quite 1
mistook 1
mr 5
darcy 2
he 962
only 1
meant 3
that 11
there 21
was 93
not 85
such 2
a 6799
variety 2
of 109
people 4
to 805
be 1200
met 180
with 34
in 2719
the 193
country 12
as 509
in 2719
the 193
town 27
which 2
you 29
must 28
acknowledge 3
to 805
be 1200
true 9
certainly 1
my 90
dear 15
nobody 2
said 1
there 21
were 5
but 82
as 509
to 805
not 85
meeting 6
with 34
many 2
people 4
in 2719
this 6
i 4330
believe 6
there 21
are 12
few 6
larger 1
i 4330
know 12
we 444
dine 9
with 34
four 26
and 51
twenty 2
families 1
nothing 5
but 82
concern 6
for 484
elizabeth 5
could 2
enable 6
to 805
keep 11
his 43
countenance 4
his 43
sister 9
was 93
less 19
delicate 7
and 51
directed 1
her 181
eyes 8
towards 1
mr 5
darcy 2
with 34
a 6799
very 1
expressive 4
smile 7
elizabeth 5
for 484
the 193
sake 2
of 109
saying 3
something 3
that 11
might 9
turn 46
her 181
mother's 1
thoughts 1
now 10
asked 1
her 181
if 8
charlotte 4
lucas 1
had 11
been 1
at 272
since 7
her 181
coming 3
away 1
yes 16
she 199
called 1
yesterday 3
with 34
her 181
father 12
what 14
an 970
agreeable 3
man 342
sir 22
william 3
is 124
mr 5
is 124
not 85
he 962
so 797
much 2
the 193
man 342
of 109
fashion 10
so 797
genteel 4
and 51
easy 2
he 962
has 41
always 1
something 3
to 805
say 7
to 805
everybody 2
that 11
is 124
my 90
idea 21
of 109
good 28
breeding 2
and 51
those 1
persons 1
who 79
fancy 5
themselves 1
very 1
important 2
and 51
never 3
open 21
their 2
mouths 1
quite 1
mistake 5
the 193
matter 7
did 23
charlotte 4
dine 9
with 34
you 29
no 896
she 199
would 5
go 500
home 90
i 4330
fancy 5
she 199
was 93
wanted 1
about 1
the 193
mince 9
pies 1
for 484
my 90
part 102
mr 5
i 4330
always 1
keep 11
servants 1
that 11
can 287
do 814
their 2
own 9
work 87
my 90
daughters 1
are 12
brought 1
up 194
very 1
differently 1
but 82
everybody 2
is 124
to 805
judge 6
for 484
themselves 1
and 51
the 193
are 12
a 6799
very 1
good 28
sort 14
of 109
girls 1
i 4330
assure 6
you 29
it 67
is 124
a 6799
pity 4
they 5
are 12
not 85
handsome 6
not 85
that 11
i 4330
think 8
charlotte 4
so 797
very 1
plain 27
but 82
then 5
she 199
is 124
our 3
particular 13
friend 14
she 199
seems 1
a 6799
very 1
pleasant 9
young 9
woman 21
oh 17
dear 15
yes 16
but 82
you 29
must 28
own 9
she 199
is 124
very 1
plain 27
lady 18
lucas 1
herself 1
has 41
often 4
said 1
so 797
and 51
envied 1
me 1041
beauty 2
i 4330
do 814
not 85
like 22
to 805
boast 12
of 109
my 90
own 9
child 28
but 82
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
jane 8
one 19
does 5
not 85
often 4
see 70
anybody 2
better 7
looking 1
it 67
is 124
what 14
everybody 2
says 1
i 4330
do 814
not 85
trust 26
my 90
own 9
partiality 2
when 6
she 199
was 93
only 1
fifteen 6
there 21
was 93
a 6799
man 342
at 272
my 90
brother 9
in 2719
town 27
so 797
much 2
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 181
that 11
my 90
sister 9
in 2719
law 45
was 93
sure 11
he 962
would 5
make 17
her 181
an 970
offer 10
before 2
we 444
came 36
away 1
but 82
however 1
he 962
did 23
not 85
perhaps 1
he 962
thought 11
her 181
too 50
young 9
however 1
he 962
wrote 1
some 30
verses 1
on 86
her 181
and 51
very 1
pretty 3
they 5
were 5
and 51
so 797
ended 1
his 43
affection 5
said 1
elizabeth 5
impatiently 1
there 21
has 41
been 1
many 2
a 6799
one 19
i 4330
fancy 5
overcome 2
in 2719
the 193
same 5
way 27
i 4330
wonder 17
who 79
first 8
discovered 1
the 193
efficacy 2
of 109
poetry 2
in 2719
driving 2
away 1
love 29
i 4330
have 11
been 1
used 1
to 805
consider 13
poetry 2
as 509
the 193
food 9
of 109
love 29
said 1
darcy 2
of 109
a 6799
fine 17
stout 9
healthy 1
love 29
it 67
may 49
everything 2
nourishes 1
what 14
is 124
strong 16
already 1
but 82
if 8
it 67
be 1200
only 1
a 6799
slight 10
thin 35
sort 14
of 109
inclination 3
i 4330
am 392
convinced 1
that 11
one 19
good 28
sonnet 3
will 39
starve 6
it 67
entirely 1
away 1
darcy 2
only 1
smiled 1
and 51
the 193
general 22
pause 4
which 2
ensued 1
made 13
elizabeth 5
tremble 4
lest 5
her 181
mother 21
should 7
be 1200
exposing 1
herself 1
again 2
she 199
longed 1
to 805
speak 12
but 82
could 2
think 8
of 109
nothing 5
to 805
say 7
and 51
after 48
a 6799
short 62
silence 7
mrs 1
bennet 1
began 1
repeating 2
her 181
thanks 4
to 805
mr 5
for 484
his 43
kindness 3
to 805
jane 8
with 34
an 970
apology 2
for 484
troubling 1
him 9
also 3
with 34
lizzy 2
mr 5
was 93
unaffectedly 1
civil 15
in 2719
his 43
answer 8
and 51
forced 1
his 43
younger 1
sister 9
to 805
be 1200
civil 15
also 3
and 51
say 7
what 14
the 193
occasion 7
required 1
she 199
performed 1
her 181
part 102
indeed 1
without 1
much 2
graciousness 2
but 82
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
satisfied 1
and 51
soon 3
afterwards 1
ordered 1
her 181
carriage 5
upon 1
this 6
signal 18
the 193
youngest 1
of 109
her 181
daughters 1
put 47
herself 1
forward 12
the 193
two 14
girls 1
had 11
been 1
whispering 1
to 805
each 1
other 5
during 1
the 193
whole 26
visit 14
and 51
the 193
result 8
of 109
it 67
was 93
that 11
the 193
youngest 1
should 7
tax 42
mr 5
with 34
having 1
promised 1
on 86
his 43
first 8
coming 3
into 26
the 193
country 12
to 805
give 15
a 6799
ball 77
at 272
lydia 4
was 93
a 6799
stout 9
well 24
grown 4
girl 14
of 109
fifteen 6
with 34
a 6799
fine 17
complexion 5
and 51
good 28
countenance 4
a 6799
with 34
her 181
mother 21
whose 1
affection 5
had 11
brought 1
her 181
into 26
public 18
at 272
an 970
early 1
age 24
she 199
had 11
high 54
animal 6
spirits 1
and 51
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
natural 18
self 11
consequence 3
which 2
the 193
attention 3
of 109
the 193
officers 1
to 805
whom 3
her 181
uncle's 1
good 28
dinners 1
and 51
her 181
own 9
easy 2
manners 1
recommended 1
her 181
had 11
increased 1
into 26
assurance 3
she 199
was 93
very 1
equal 17
therefore 1
to 805
address 9
mr 5
on 86
the 193
subject 11
of 109
the 193
ball 77
and 51
abruptly 1
reminded 1
him 9
of 109
his 43
promise 4
adding 1
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
the 193
most 3
shameful 4
thing 15
in 2719
the 193
world 12
if 8
he 962
did 23
not 85
keep 11
it 67
his 43
answer 8
to 805
this 6
sudden 4
attack 8
was 93
delightful 2
to 805
their 2
mother's 1
ear 114
i 4330
am 392
perfectly 1
ready 2
i 4330
assure 6
you 29
to 805
keep 11
my 90
engagement 3
and 51
when 6
your 4
sister 9
is 124
recovered 1
you 29
shall 12
if 8
you 29
please 3
name 17
the 193
very 1
day 27
of 109
the 193
ball 77
but 82
you 29
would 5
not 85
wish 13
to 805
be 1200
dancing 2
when 6
she 199
is 124
ill 84
lydia 4
declared 1
herself 1
satisfied 1
oh 17
yes 16
it 67
would 5
be 1200
much 2
better 7
to 805
wait 19
till 14
jane 8
was 93
well 24
and 51
by 57
that 11
time 45
most 3
likely 1
captain 8
carter 3
would 5
be 1200
at 272
again 2
and 51
when 6
you 29
have 11
given 3
your 4
ball 77
she 199
added 1
i 4330
shall 12
insist 9
on 86
their 2
giving 2
one 19
also 3
i 4330
shall 12
tell 16
colonel 5
forster 1
it 67
will 39
be 1200
quite 1
a 6799
shame 14
if 8
he 962
does 5
not 85
mrs 1
bennet 1
and 51
her 181
daughters 1
then 5
departed 2
and 51
elizabeth 5
returned 1
instantly 1
to 805
jane 8
leaving 3
her 181
own 9
and 51
her 181
to 805
the 193
remarks 1
of 109
the 193
two 14
ladies 1
and 51
mr 5
darcy 2
the 193
latter 3
of 109
whom 3
however 1
could 2
not 85
be 1200
prevailed 1
on 86
to 805
join 16
in 2719
their 2
censure 7
of 109
her 181
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
all 162
miss 71
witticisms 1
on 86
fine 17
eyes 8
chapter 3
the 193
day 27
passed 1
much 2
as 509
the 193
day 27
before 2
had 11
done 3
mrs 1
hurst 2
and 51
miss 71
had 11
spent 1
some 30
hours 1
of 109
the 193
morning 3
with 34
the 193
invalid 16
who 79
continued 1
though 12
slowly 1
to 805
mend 31
and 51
in 2719
the 193
evening 3
elizabeth 5
joined 1
their 2
party 3
in 2719
the 193
drawing 3
room 22
the 193
loo 65
table 27
however 1
did 23
not 85
appear 7
mr 5
darcy 2
was 93
writing 3
and 51
miss 71
seated 1
near 15
him 9
was 93
watching 1
the 193
progress 14
of 109
his 43
letter 20
and 51
repeatedly 1
calling 3
off 100
his 43
attention 3
by 57
messages 1
to 805
his 43
sister 9
mr 5
hurst 2
and 51
mr 5
were 5
at 272
and 51
mrs 1
hurst 2
was 93
observing 1
their 2
game 24
elizabeth 5
took 1
up 194
some 30
needlework 2
and 51
was 93
sufficiently 1
amused 1
in 2719
attending 1
to 805
what 14
passed 1
between 1
darcy 2
and 51
his 43
companion 10
the 193
perpetual 4
commendations 1
of 109
the 193
lady 18
either 1
on 86
his 43
handwriting 2
or 333
on 86
the 193
evenness 2
of 109
his 43
lines 4
or 333
on 86
the 193
length 14
of 109
his 43
letter 20
with 34
the 193
perfect 24
unconcern 4
with 34
which 2
her 181
praises 1
were 5
received 1
formed 1
a 6799
curious 4
dialogue 3
and 51
was 93
exactly 1
in 2719
union 14
with 34
her 181
opinion 4
of 109
each 1
how 27
delighted 2
miss 71
darcy 2
will 39
be 1200
to 805
receive 8
such 2
a 6799
letter 20
he 962
made 13
no 896
answer 8
you 29
write 5
uncommonly 1
fast 29
you 29
are 12
mistaken 2
i 4330
write 5
rather 2
slowly 1
how 27
many 2
letters 1
you 29
must 28
have 11
occasion 7
to 805
write 5
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
a 6799
year 19
letters 1
of 109
business 13
too 50
how 27
odious 4
i 4330
should 7
think 8
them 9
it 67
is 124
fortunate 2
then 5
that 11
they 5
fall 29
to 805
my 90
lot 21
instead 1
of 109
yours 3
pray 9
tell 16
your 4
sister 9
that 11
i 4330
long 49
to 805
see 70
her 181
i 4330
have 11
already 1
told 1
her 181
so 797
once 2
by 57
your 4
desire 6
i 4330
am 392
afraid 1
you 29
do 814
not 85
like 22
your 4
pen 195
let 50
me 1041
mend 31
it 67
for 484
you 29
i 4330
mend 31
pens 16
remarkably 1
well 24
thank 15
you 29
but 82
i 4330
always 1
mend 31
my 90
own 9
how 27
can 287
you 29
contrive 6
to 805
write 5
so 797
even 36
he 962
was 93
silent 6
tell 16
your 4
sister 9
i 4330
am 392
delighted 2
to 805
hear 76
of 109
her 181
improvement 3
on 86
the 193
harp 27
and 51
pray 9
let 50
her 181
know 12
that 11
i 4330
am 392
quite 1
in 2719
raptures 1
with 34
her 181
beautiful 2
little 6
design 16
for 484
a 6799
table 27
and 51
i 4330
think 8
it 67
infinitely 1
superior 5
to 805
miss 71
will 39
you 29
give 15
me 1041
leave 14

of 109
no 896
consequence 3
i 4330
shall 12

you 29
always 1
write 5
such 2
charming 2
long 49
letters 1
to 805
her 181
mr 5
darcy 2
they 5
are 12
generally 1
long 49
but 82
whether 1
always 1
charming 2
it 67
is 124
not 85
for 484
me 1041
to 805
determine 7
it 67
is 124
a 6799
rule 7
with 34
me 1041
that 11
a 6799
person 33
who 79
can 287
write 5
a 6799
long 49
letter 20
with 34
ease 10
cannot 1
write 5
ill 84
that 11
will 39
not 85
do 814
for 484
a 6799
compliment 6
to 805
darcy 2
caroline 1
cried 1
her 181
brother 9
because 1
he 962
does 5
not 85
write 5
with 34
ease 10
he 962
studies 1
too 50
much 2
for 484
words 5
of 109
four 26
syllables 1
do 814
not 85
you 29
darcy 2
my 90
style 4
of 109
writing 3
is 124
very 1
different 11
from 2
yours 3
oh 17
cried 1
miss 71
charles 5
writes 1
in 2719
the 193
most 3
careless 4
way 27
imaginable 1
he 962
leaves 1
out 365
half 23
his 43
words 5
and 51
blots 1
the 193
rest 110
my 90
ideas 1
flow 27
so 797
rapidly 1
that 11
i 4330
have 11
not 85
time 45
to 805
express 25
them 9
by 57
which 2
means 1
my 90
letters 1
sometimes 1
convey 12
no 896
ideas 1
at 272
all 162
to 805
my 90
correspondents 1
your 4
humility 2
mr 5
said 1
elizabeth 5
must 28
disarm 7
reproof 5
nothing 5
is 124
more 11
deceitful 4
said 1
darcy 2
than 22
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
humility 2
it 67
is 124
often 4
only 1
carelessness 2
of 109
opinion 4
and 51
sometimes 1
an 970
indirect 6
boast 12
and 51
which 2
of 109
the 193
two 14
do 814
you 29
call 57
my 90
little 6
recent 6
piece 10
of 109
modesty 2
the 193
indirect 6
boast 12
for 484
you 29
are 12
really 1
proud 5
of 109
your 4
defects 1
in 2719
writing 3
because 1
you 29
consider 13
them 9
as 509
proceeding 3
from 2
a 6799
rapidity 2
of 109
thought 11
and 51
carelessness 2
of 109
execution 6
which 2
if 8
not 85
estimable 1
you 29
think 8
at 272
least 3
highly 1
interesting 2
the 193
power 19
of 109
doing 3
anything 3
with 34
quickness 2
is 124
always 1
prized 1
much 2
by 57
the 193
possessor 3
and 51
often 4
without 1
any 17
attention 3
to 805
the 193
imperfection 3
of 109
the 193
performance 3
when 6
you 29
told 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
this 6
morning 3
that 11
if 8
you 29
ever 33
resolved 1
upon 1
quitting 1
you 29
should 7
be 1200
gone 4
in 2719
five 5
minutes 2
you 29
meant 3
it 67
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
panegyric 3
of 109
compliment 6
to 805
yourself 1
and 51
yet 4
what 14
is 124
there 21
so 797
very 1
laudable 1
in 2719
a 6799
which 2
must 28
leave 14
very 1
necessary 2
business 13
undone 1
and 51
can 287
be 1200
of 109
no 896
real 47
advantage 6
to 805
yourself 1
or 333
anyone 2
else 2
nay 6
cried 1
this 6
is 124
too 50
much 2
to 805
remember 4
at 272
night 61
all 162
the 193
foolish 4
things 1
that 11
were 5
said 1
in 2719
the 193
morning 3
and 51
yet 4
upon 1
my 90
i 4330
believe 6
what 14
i 4330
said 1
of 109
myself 1
to 805
be 1200
true 9
and 51
i 4330
believe 6
it 67
at 272
this 6
moment 14
at 272
least 3
therefore 1
i 4330
did 23
not 85
assume 3
the 193
character 16
of 109
needless 4
merely 1
to 805
show 64
off 100
before 2
the 193
ladies 1
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
you 29
believed 1
it 67
but 82
i 4330
am 392
by 57
no 896
means 1
convinced 1
that 11
you 29
would 5
be 1200
gone 4
with 34
such 2
celerity 2
your 4
conduct 21
would 5
be 1200
quite 1
as 509
dependent 4
on 86
chance 20
as 509
that 11
of 109
any 17
man 342
i 4330
know 12
and 51
if 8
as 509
you 29
were 5
mounting 3
your 4
horse 52
a 6799
friend 14
were 5
to 805
say 7
you 29
had 11
better 7
stay 7
till 14
next 2
week 20
you 29
would 5
probably 1
do 814
it 67
you 29
would 5
probably 1
not 85
go 500
and 51
at 272
another 1
word 26
might 9
stay 7
a 6799
month 6
you 29
have 11
only 1
proved 1
by 57
this 6
cried 1
elizabeth 5
that 11
mr 5
did 23
not 85
do 814
justice 3
to 805
his 43
own 9
disposition 3
you 29
have 11
shown 1
him 9
off 100
now 10
much 2
more 11
than 22
he 962
did 23
himself 1
i 4330
am 392
exceedingly 1
gratified 1
said 1
by 57
your 4
converting 1
what 14
my 90
friend 14
says 1
into 26
a 6799
compliment 6
on 86
the 193
sweetness 2
of 109
my 90
temper 22
but 82
i 4330
am 392
afraid 1
you 29
are 12
giving 2
it 67
a 6799
turn 46
which 2
that 11
gentleman 3
did 23
by 57
no 896
means 1
intend 6
for 484
he 962
would 5
certainly 1
think 8
better 7
of 109
me 1041
if 8
under 288
such 2
a 6799
circumstance 4
i 4330
were 5
to 805
give 15
a 6799
flat 66
denial 3
and 51
ride 9
off 100
as 509
fast 29
as 509
i 4330
could 2
would 5
mr 5
darcy 2
then 5
consider 13
the 193
rashness 2
of 109
your 4
original 6
intentions 1
as 509
atoned 1
for 484
by 57
your 4
obstinacy 2
in 2719
adhering 1
to 805
it 67
upon 1
my 90
word 26
i 4330
cannot 1
exactly 1
explain 5
the 193
matter 7
darcy 2
must 28
speak 12
for 484
himself 1
you 29
expect 20
me 1041
to 805
account 14
for 484
opinions 1
which 2
you 29
choose 5
to 805
call 57
mine 26
but 82
which 2
i 4330
have 11
never 3
acknowledged 1
allowing 1
the 193
case 25
however 1
to 805
stand 42
according 2
to 805
your 4
representation 4
you 29
must 28
remember 4
miss 71
bennet 1
that 11
the 193
friend 14
who 79
is 124
supposed 2
to 805
desire 6
his 43
return 14
to 805
the 193
house 87
and 51
the 193
delay 8
of 109
his 43
plan 61
has 41
merely 1
desired 1
it 67
asked 1
it 67
without 1
offering 3
one 19
argument 9
in 2719
of 109
its 2
propriety 2
to 805
yield 6
readily 1
easily 1
to 805
the 193
persuasion 3
of 109
a 6799
friend 14
is 124
no 896
merit 13
with 34
you 29
to 805
yield 6
without 1
conviction 3
is 124
no 896
compliment 6
to 805
the 193
understanding 4
of 109
either 1
you 29
appear 7
to 805
me 1041
mr 5
darcy 2
to 805
allow 9
nothing 5
for 484
the 193
influence 4
of 109
friendship 3
and 51
affection 5
a 6799
regard 7
for 484
the 193
requester 1
would 5
often 4
make 17
one 19
readily 1
yield 6
to 805
a 6799
request 6
without 1
waiting 2
for 484
arguments 1
to 805
reason 13
one 19
into 26
it 67
i 4330
am 392
not 85
particularly 1
speaking 2
of 109
such 2
a 6799
case 25
as 509
you 29
have 11
supposed 2
about 1
mr 5
we 444
may 49
as 509
well 24
wait 19
perhaps 1
till 14
the 193
circumstance 4
occurs 1
before 2
we 444
discuss 10
the 193
discretion 3
of 109
his 43
thereupon 1
but 82
in 2719
general 22
and 51
ordinary 2
cases 1
between 1
friend 14
and 51
friend 14
where 21
one 19
of 109
them 9
is 124
desired 1
by 57
the 193
other 5
to 805
change 21
a 6799
resolution 3
of 109
no 896
very 1
great 12
moment 14
should 7
you 29
think 8
ill 84
of 109
that 11
person 33
for 484
complying 1
with 34
the 193
desire 6
without 1
waiting 2
to 805
be 1200
argued 1
into 26
it 67
will 39
it 67
not 85
be 1200
advisable 1
before 2
we 444
proceed 7
on 86
this 6
subject 11
to 805
arrange 9
with 34
rather 2
more 11
precision 2
the 193
degree 3
of 109
importance 2
which 2
is 124
to 805
appertain 4
to 805
this 6
request 6
as 509
well 24
as 509
the 193
degree 3
of 109
intimacy 2
subsisting 1
between 1
the 193
parties 1
by 57
all 162
means 1
cried 1
let 50
us 70
hear 76
all 162
the 193
particulars 1
not 85
forgetting 1
their 2
comparative 4
height 7
and 51
size 5
for 484
that 11
will 39
have 11
more 11
weight 21
in 2719
the 193
argument 9
miss 71
bennet 1
than 22
you 29
may 49
be 1200
aware 3
of 109
i 4330
assure 6
you 29
that 11
if 8
darcy 2
were 5
not 85
such 2
a 6799
great 12
tall 35
fellow 9
in 2719
comparison 3
with 34
myself 1
i 4330
should 7
not 85
pay 52
him 9
half 23
so 797
much 2
deference 2
i 4330
declare 6
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
a 6799
more 11
awful 6
object 26
than 22
darcy 2
on 86
particular 13
occasions 1
and 51
in 2719
particular 13
places 1
at 272
his 43
own 9
house 87
especially 1
and 51
of 109
a 6799
sunday 3
evening 3
when 6
he 962
has 41
nothing 5
to 805
do 814
mr 5
darcy 2
smiled 1
but 82
elizabeth 5
thought 11
she 199
could 2
perceive 3
that 11
he 962
was 93
rather 2
offended 1
and 51
therefore 1
checked 1
her 181
laugh 14
miss 71
warmly 1
resented 1
the 193
indignity 2
he 962
had 11
received 1
in 2719
an 970
expostulation 3
with 34
her 181
brother 9
for 484
talking 1
such 2
nonsense 2
i 4330
see 70
your 4
design 16
said 1
his 43
friend 14
you 29
dislike 4
an 970
argument 9
and 51
want 13
to 805
silence 7
this 6
perhaps 1
i 4330
do 814
arguments 1
are 12
too 50
much 2
like 22
disputes 1
if 8
you 29
and 51
miss 71
bennet 1
will 39
defer 14
yours 3
till 14
i 4330
am 392
out 365
of 109
the 193
room 22
i 4330
shall 12
be 1200
very 1
thankful 4
and 51
then 5
you 29
may 49
say 7
whatever 1
you 29
like 22
of 109
me 1041
what 14
you 29
ask 6
said 1
elizabeth 5
is 124
no 896
sacrifice 4
on 86
my 90
side 74
and 51
mr 5
darcy 2
had 11
much 2
better 7
finish 8
his 43
letter 20
mr 5
darcy 2
took 1
her 181
advice 2
and 51
did 23
finish 8
his 43
letter 20
when 6
that 11
business 13
was 93
over 596
he 962
applied 1
to 805
miss 71
and 51
elizabeth 5
for 484
an 970
indulgence 3
of 109
some 30
music 24
miss 71
moved 1
with 34
some 30
alacrity 2
to 805
the 193
pianoforte 3
and 51
after 48
a 6799
polite 8
request 6
that 11
elizabeth 5
would 5
lead 15
the 193
way 27
which 2
the 193
other 5
as 509
politely 1
and 51
more 11
earnestly 1
negatived 1
she 199
seated 1
herself 1
mrs 1
hurst 2
sang 11
with 34
her 181
sister 9
and 51
while 4
they 5
were 5
thus 1
employed 1
elizabeth 5
could 2
not 85
help 23
observing 1
as 509
she 199
turned 1
over 596
some 30
music 24
books 15
that 11
lay 42
on 86
the 193
instrument 16
how 27
frequently 1
mr 5
darcy's 1
eyes 8
were 5
fixed 2
on 86
her 181
she 199
hardly 1
knew 1
how 27
to 805
suppose 4
that 11
she 199
could 2
be 1200
an 970
object 26
of 109
admiration 2
to 805
so 797
great 12
a 6799
man 342
and 51
yet 4
that 11
he 962
should 7
look 14
at 272
her 181
because 1
he 962
disliked 1
her 181
was 93
still 13
more 11
strange 8
she 199
could 2
only 1
imagine 3
however 1
at 272
last 7
that 11
she 199
drew 2
his 43
notice 8
because 1
there 21
was 93
something 3
more 11
wrong 24
and 51
reprehensible 1
according 2
to 805
his 43
ideas 1
of 109
right 31
than 22
in 2719
any 17
other 5
person 33
present 20
the 193
supposition 3
did 23
not 85
pain 42
her 181
she 199
liked 1
him 9
too 50
little 6
to 805
care 47
for 484
his 43
approbation 3
after 48
playing 1
some 30
italian 4
songs 7
miss 71
varied 1
the 193
charm 14
by 57
a 6799
lively 1
scotch 12
air 129
and 51
soon 3
afterwards 1
mr 5
darcy 2
drawing 3
near 15
elizabeth 5
said 1
to 805
her 181
do 814
not 85
you 29
feel 11
a 6799
great 12
inclination 3
miss 71
bennet 1
to 805
seize 3
such 2
an 970
opportunity 2
of 109
dancing 2
a 6799
reel 12
she 199
smiled 1
but 82
made 13
no 896
answer 8
he 962
repeated 2
the 193
question 16
with 34
some 30
surprise 4
at 272
her 181
silence 7
oh 17
said 1
she 199
i 4330
heard 1
you 29
before 2
but 82
i 4330
could 2
not 85
immediately 1
determine 7
what 14
to 805
say 7
in 2719
reply 3
you 29
wanted 1
me 1041
i 4330
know 12
to 805
say 7
that 11
you 29
might 9
have 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
despising 1
my 90
taste 15
but 82
i 4330
always 1
delight 8
in 2719
overthrowing 1
those 1
kind 31
of 109
schemes 1
and 51
cheating 1
a 6799
person 33
of 109
their 2
premeditated 1
contempt 8
i 4330
have 11
therefore 1
made 13
up 194
my 90
mind 25
to 805
tell 16
you 29
that 11
i 4330

to 805
dance 7
a 6799
reel 12
at 272

and 51
now 10

elizabeth 5
having 1
rather 2
expected 1
to 805
affront 5
him 9
was 93
amazed 1
at 272
his 43
gallantry 2
but 82
there 21
was 93
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109
sweetness 2
and 51
archness 2
in 2719
her 181
manner 8
which 2
made 13
it 67
difficult 5
for 484
her 181
to 805
affront 5
anybody 2
and 51
darcy 2
had 11
never 3
been 1
so 797
bewitched 1
by 57
any 17
woman 21
as 509
he 962
was 93
by 57
her 181
he 962
really 1
believed 1
that 11
were 5
it 67
not 85
for 484
the 193
inferiority 2
of 109
her 181
connections 1
he 962
should 7
be 1200
in 2719
some 30
danger 7
miss 71
saw 24
or 333
suspected 1
enough 2
to 805
be 1200
jealous 5
and 51
her 181
great 12
anxiety 2
for 484
the 193
recovery 2
of 109
her 181
dear 15
friend 14
jane 8
received 1
some 30
assistance 2
from 2
her 181
desire 6
of 109
getting 1
rid 42
of 109
elizabeth 5
she 199
often 4
tried 1
to 805
provoke 6
darcy 2
into 26
disliking 1
her 181
guest 9
by 57
talking 1
of 109
their 2
supposed 2
marriage 6
and 51
planning 2
his 43
happiness 2
in 2719
such 2
an 970
alliance 3
i 4330
hope 16
said 1
she 199
as 509
they 5
were 5
walking 2
together 3
in 2719
the 193
shrubbery 2
the 193
next 2
day 27
you 29
will 39
give 15
your 4
mother 21
in 2719
law 45
a 6799
few 6
hints 1
when 6
this 6
desirable 3
event 18
takes 1
place 29
as 509
to 805
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
holding 3
her 181
tongue 5
and 51
if 8
you 29
can 287
compass 9
it 67
do 814
cure 9
the 193
younger 1
girls 1
of 109
running 2
after 48
officers 1
and 51
if 8
i 4330
may 49
mention 5
so 797
delicate 7
a 6799
subject 11
to 805
check 40
that 11
little 6
something 3
bordering 1
on 86
conceit 7
and 51
impertinence 3
which 2
your 4
lady 18
possesses 1
have 11
you 29
anything 3
else 2
to 805
propose 6
for 484
my 90
domestic 12
felicity 2
oh 17
yes 16
do 814
let 50
the 193
portraits 1
of 109
your 4
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
phillips 1
be 1200
placed 1
in 2719
the 193
gallery 2
at 272
put 47
them 9
next 2
to 805
your 4
great 12
uncle 18
the 193
judge 6
they 5
are 12
in 2719
the 193
same 5
profession 14
you 29
know 12
only 1
in 2719
different 11
lines 4
as 509
for 484
your 4
elizabeth's 1
picture 8
you 29
must 28
not 85
have 11
it 67
taken 1
for 484
what 14
painter 4
could 2
do 814
justice 3
to 805
those 1
beautiful 2
eyes 8
it 67
would 5
not 85
be 1200
easy 2
indeed 1
to 805
catch 24
their 2
expression 11
but 82
their 2
and 51
shape 13
and 51
the 193
eyelashes 1
so 797
remarkably 1
fine 17
might 9
be 1200
copied 1
at 272
that 11
moment 14
they 5
were 5
met 180
from 2
another 1
walk 25
by 57
mrs 1
hurst 2
and 51
elizabeth 5
herself 1
i 4330
did 23
not 85
know 12
that 11
you 29
intended 3
to 805
walk 25
said 1
miss 71
in 2719
some 30
confusion 3
lest 5
they 5
had 11
been 1
overheard 1
you 29
used 1
us 70
abominably 1
ill 84
answered 1
mrs 1
hurst 2
running 2
away 1
without 1
telling 2
us 70
that 11
you 29
were 5
coming 3
out 365
then 5
taking 4
the 193
disengaged 1
arm 82
of 109
mr 5
darcy 2
she 199
left 19
elizabeth 5
to 805
walk 25
by 57
herself 1
the 193
path 25
just 24
admitted 2
three 12
mr 5
darcy 2
felt 5
their 2
rudeness 2
and 51
immediately 1
said 1
this 6
walk 25
is 124
not 85
wide 15
enough 2
for 484
our 3
party 3
we 444
had 11
better 7
go 500
into 26
the 193
avenue 3
but 82
elizabeth 5
who 79
had 11
not 85
the 193
least 3
inclination 3
to 805
remain 9
with 34
them 9
laughingly 1
answered 1
no 896
no 896
stay 7
where 21
you 29
are 12
you 29
are 12
charmingly 1
grouped 1
and 51
appear 7
to 805
uncommon 6
advantage 6
the 193
picturesque 4
would 5
be 1200
by 57
admitting 1
a 6799
fourth 4
good 28
bye 5
she 199
then 5
ran 110
gaily 1
off 100
rejoicing 3
as 509
she 199
rambled 1
about 1
in 2719
the 193
hope 16
of 109
being 3
at 272
home 90
again 2
in 2719
a 6799
day 27
or 333
two 14
jane 8
was 93
already 1
so 797
much 2
recovered 1
as 509
to 805
intend 6
leaving 3
her 181
room 22
for 484
a 6799
couple 7
of 109
hours 1
that 11
evening 3
chapter 3
when 6
the 193
ladies 1
removed 1
after 48
dinner 9
elizabeth 5
ran 110
up 194
to 805
her 181
sister 9
and 51
seeing 2
her 181
well 24
guarded 2
from 2
cold 9
attended 1
her 181
into 26
the 193
drawing 3
room 22
where 21
she 199
was 93
welcomed 1
by 57
her 181
two 14
friends 4
with 34
many 2
professions 1
of 109
pleasure 5
and 51
elizabeth 5
had 11
never 3
seen 1
them 9
so 797
agreeable 3
as 509
they 5
were 5
during 1
the 193
hour 10
which 2
passed 1
before 2
the 193
gentlemen 1
appeared 1
their 2
powers 1
of 109
conversation 8
were 5
considerable 1
they 5
could 2
describe 6
an 970
entertainment 3
with 34
accuracy 2
relate 8
an 970
anecdote 3
with 34
and 51
laugh 14
at 272
their 2
acquaintance 5
with 34
spirit 20
but 82
when 6
the 193
gentlemen 1
entered 1
jane 8
was 93
no 896
longer 1
the 193
first 8
object 26
miss 71
eyes 8
were 5
instantly 1
turned 1
toward 2
darcy 2
and 51
she 199
had 11
something 3
to 805
say 7
to 805
him 9
before 2
he 962
had 11
advanced 1
many 2
steps 7
he 962
addressed 1
himself 1
to 805
miss 71
bennet 1
with 34
a 6799
polite 8
congratulation 3
mr 5
hurst 2
also 3
made 13
her 181
a 6799
slight 10
bow 58
and 51
said 1
he 962
was 93
very 1
glad 30
but 82
diffuseness 2
and 51
warmth 2
remained 1
for 484
salutation 3
he 962
was 93
full 16
of 109
joy 36
and 51
attention 3
the 193
first 8
half 23
hour 10
was 93
spent 1
in 2719
piling 3
up 194
the 193
fire 103
lest 5
she 199
should 7
suffer 11
from 2
the 193
change 21
of 109
room 22
and 51
she 199
removed 1
at 272
his 43
desire 6
to 805
the 193
other 5
side 74
of 109
the 193
fireplace 3
that 11
she 199
might 9
be 1200
further 8
from 2
the 193
door 41
he 962
then 5
sat 92
down 90
by 57
her 181
and 51
talked 1
scarcely 1
to 805
anyone 2
else 2
elizabeth 5
at 272
work 87
in 2719
the 193
opposite 4
corner 8
saw 24
it 67
all 162
with 34
great 12
delight 8
when 6
tea 99
was 93
over 596
mr 5
hurst 2
reminded 1
his 43
sister 9
in 2719
law 45
of 109
the 193
card 54
table 27
but 82
in 2719
vain 8
she 199
had 11
obtained 1
private 9
intelligence 2
that 11
mr 5
darcy 2
did 23
not 85
wish 13
for 484
cards 7
and 51
mr 5
hurst 2
soon 3
found 18
even 36
his 43
open 21
petition 8
rejected 1
she 199
assured 4
him 9
that 11
no 896
one 19
intended 3
to 805
play 73
and 51
the 193
silence 7
of 109
the 193
whole 26
party 3
on 86
the 193
subject 11
seemed 1
to 805
justify 2
her 181
mr 5
hurst 2
had 11
therefore 1
nothing 5
to 805
do 814
but 82
to 805
stretch 15
himself 1
on 86
one 19
of 109
the 193
sofas 1
and 51
go 500
to 805
sleep 33
darcy 2
took 1
up 194
a 6799
book 69
miss 71
did 23
the 193
same 5
and 51
mrs 1
hurst 2
principally 1
occupied 1
in 2719
playing 1
with 34
her 181
bracelets 1
and 51
rings 3
joined 1
now 10
and 51
then 5
in 2719
her 181
brother's 1
conversation 8
with 34
miss 71
bennet 1
miss 71
attention 3
was 93
quite 1
as 509
much 2
engaged 1
in 2719
watching 1
mr 5
darcy's 1
progress 14
through 4
his 43
book 69
as 509
in 2719
reading 3
her 181
own 9
and 51
she 199
was 93
perpetually 1
either 1
making 4
some 30
inquiry 2
or 333
looking 1
at 272
his 43
page 15
she 199
could 2
not 85
win 229
him 9
however 1
to 805
any 17
conversation 8
he 962
merely 1
answered 1
her 181
question 16
and 51
read 49
on 86
at 272
length 14
quite 1
exhausted 1
by 57
the 193
attempt 5
to 805
be 1200
amused 1
with 34
her 181
own 9
book 69
which 2
she 199
had 11
only 1
chosen 1
because 1
it 67
was 93
the 193
second 16
volume 3
of 109
his 43
she 199
gave 4
a 6799
great 12
yawn 8
and 51
said 1
how 27
pleasant 9
it 67
is 124
to 805
spend 11
an 970
evening 3
in 2719
this 6
way 27
i 4330
declare 6
after 48
all 162
there 21
is 124
no 896
enjoyment 3
like 22
reading 3
how 27
much 2
sooner 1
one 19
tires 7
of 109
anything 3
than 22
of 109
a 6799
book 69
when 6
i 4330
have 11
a 6799
house 87
of 109
my 90
own 9
i 4330
shall 12
be 1200
miserable 3
if 8
i 4330
have 11
not 85
an 970
excellent 2
library 2
no 896
one 19
made 13
any 17
reply 3
she 199
then 5
yawned 1
again 2
threw 1
aside 3
her 181
book 69
and 51
cast 54
her 181
eyes 8
round 29
the 193
room 22
in 2719
quest 21
for 484
some 30
amusement 3
when 6
hearing 3
her 181
brother 9
mentioning 1
a 6799
ball 77
to 805
miss 71
bennet 1
she 199
turned 1
suddenly 1
towards 1
him 9
and 51
said 1
by 57
the 193
bye 5
charles 5
are 12
you 29
really 1
serious 4
in 2719
meditating 1
a 6799
dance 7
at 272
i 4330
would 5
advise 9
you 29
before 2
you 29
determine 7
on 86
it 67
to 805
consult 14
the 193
wishes 1
of 109
the 193
present 20
party 3
i 4330
am 392
much 2
mistaken 2
if 8
there 21
are 12
not 85
some 30
among 1
us 70
to 805
whom 3
a 6799
ball 77
would 5
be 1200
rather 2
a 6799
punishment 3
than 22
a 6799
pleasure 5
if 8
you 29
mean 36
darcy 2
cried 1
her 181
brother 9
he 962
may 49
go 500
to 805
bed 93
if 8
he 962
chooses 1
before 2
it 67
begins 1
but 82
as 509
for 484
the 193
ball 77
it 67
is 124
quite 1
a 6799
settled 1
thing 15
and 51
as 509
soon 3
as 509
has 41
made 13
white 55
soup 13
enough 2
i 4330
shall 12
send 10
round 29
my 90
cards 7
i 4330
should 7
like 22
balls 7
infinitely 1
better 7
she 199
replied 1
if 8
they 5
were 5
carried 1
on 86
in 2719
a 6799
different 11
manner 8
but 82
there 21
is 124
something 3
insufferably 1
tedious 4
in 2719
the 193
usual 3
process 16
of 109
such 2
a 6799
meeting 6
it 67
would 5
surely 1
be 1200
much 2
more 11
rational 22
if 8
conversation 8
instead 1
of 109
dancing 2
were 5
made 13
the 193
order 11
of 109
the 193
day 27
much 2
more 11
rational 22
my 90
dear 15
caroline 1
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
but 82
it 67
would 5
not 85
be 1200
near 15
so 797
much 2
like 22
a 6799
ball 77
miss 71
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
soon 3
afterwards 1
she 199
got 14
up 194
and 51
walked 1
about 1
the 193
room 22
her 181
figure 7
was 93
elegant 2
and 51
she 199
walked 1
well 24
but 82
darcy 2
at 272
whom 3
it 67
was 93
all 162
aimed 1
was 93
still 13
inflexibly 1
studious 4
in 2719
the 193
desperation 2
of 109
her 181
feelings 1
she 199
resolved 1
on 86
one 19
effort 7
more 11
and 51
turning 3
to 805
elizabeth 5
said 1
miss 71
eliza 7
bennet 1
let 50
me 1041
persuade 6
you 29
to 805
follow 11
my 90
example 4
and 51
take 18
a 6799
turn 46
about 1
the 193
room 22
i 4330
assure 6
you 29
it 67
is 124
very 1
refreshing 2
after 48
sitting 3
so 797
long 49
in 2719
one 19
attitude 3
elizabeth 5
was 93
surprised 1
but 82
agreed 1
to 805
it 67
immediately 1
miss 71
succeeded 1
no 896
less 19
in 2719
the 193
real 47
object 26
of 109
her 181
civility 2
mr 5
darcy 2
looked 1
up 194
he 962
was 93
as 509
much 2
awake 8
to 805
the 193
novelty 2
of 109
attention 3
in 2719
that 11
quarter 25
as 509
elizabeth 5
herself 1
could 2
be 1200
and 51
unconsciously 1
closed 1
his 43
book 69
he 962
was 93
directly 1
invited 1
to 805
join 16
their 2
party 3
but 82
he 962
declined 1
it 67
observing 1
that 11
he 962
could 2
imagine 3
but 82
two 14
motives 1
for 484
their 2
choosing 1
to 805
walk 25
up 194
and 51
down 90
the 193
room 22
together 3
with 34
either 1
of 109
which 2
motives 1
his 43
joining 1
them 9
would 5
interfere 5
what 14
could 2
he 962
mean 36
she 199
was 93
dying 2
to 805
know 12
what 14
could 2
be 1200
his 43
meaning 11
and 51
asked 1
elizabeth 5
whether 1
she 199
could 2
at 272
all 162
understand 8
him 9
not 85
at 272
all 162
was 93
her 181
answer 8
but 82

severe 7
on 86
us 70
and 51
our 3
surest 1
way 27
of 109
disappointing 2
him 9
will 39
be 1200
to 805
ask 6
nothing 5
about 1
it 67
miss 71
however 1
was 93
incapable 1
of 109
disappointing 2
mr 5
darcy 2
in 2719
anything 3
and 51
persevered 1
therefore 1
in 2719
requiring 1
an 970
explanation 3
of 109
his 43
two 14
motives 1
i 4330
have 11
not 85
the 193
smallest 1
objection 5
to 805
explaining 1
them 9
said 1
he 962
as 509
soon 3
as 509
she 199
allowed 1
him 9
to 805
speak 12
you 29
either 1
choose 5
this 6
method 18
of 109
passing 3
the 193
evening 3
because 1
you 29
are 12
in 2719
each 1
confidence 3
and 51
have 11
secret 25
affairs 1
to 805
discuss 10
or 333
because 1
you 29
are 12
conscious 5
that 11
your 4
figures 1
appear 7
to 805
the 193
greatest 1
advantage 6
in 2719
walking 2
if 8
the 193
first 8
i 4330
would 5
be 1200
completely 1
in 2719
your 4
way 27
and 51
if 8
the 193
second 16
i 4330
can 287
admire 6
you 29
much 2
better 7
as 509
i 4330
sit 29
by 57
the 193
fire 103
oh 17
shocking 2
cried 1
miss 71
i 4330
never 3
heard 1
anything 3
so 797
abominable 1
how 27
shall 12
we 444
punish 9
him 9
for 484
such 2
a 6799
speech 13
nothing 5
so 797
easy 2
if 8
you 29
have 11
but 82
the 193
inclination 3
said 1
elizabeth 5
we 444
can 287
all 162
plague 4
and 51
punish 9
one 19
another 1
tease 10
him 9
laugh 14
at 272
him 9
intimate 5
as 509
you 29
are 12
you 29
must 28
know 12
how 27
it 67
is 124
to 805
be 1200
done 3
but 82
upon 1
my 90
i 4330
do 814
not 85
i 4330
do 814
assure 6
you 29
that 11
my 90
intimacy 2
has 41
not 85
yet 4
taught 1
me 1041
that 11
tease 10
calmness 2
of 109
manner 8
and 51
presence 3
of 109
mind 25
no 896
no 896
i 4330
feel 11
he 962
may 49
defy 2
us 70
there 21
and 51
as 509
to 805
laughter 2
we 444
will 39
not 85
expose 4
ourselves 1
if 8
you 29
please 3
by 57
attempting 1
to 805
laugh 14
without 1
a 6799
subject 11
mr 5
darcy 2
may 49
hug 20
himself 1
mr 5
darcy 2
is 124
not 85
to 805
be 1200
laughed 1
at 272
cried 1
elizabeth 5
that 11
is 124
an 970
uncommon 6
advantage 6
and 51
uncommon 6
i 4330
hope 16
it 67
will 39
continue 3
for 484
it 67
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
great 12
loss 3
to 805
me 1041
to 805
have 11
many 2
such 2
acquaintances 3
i 4330
dearly 1
love 29
a 6799
laugh 14
miss 71
said 1
he 962
has 41
given 3
me 1041
more 11
credit 12
than 22
can 287
be 1200
the 193
wisest 1
and 51
the 193
best 37
of 109
men 140
nay 6
the 193
wisest 1
and 51
best 37
of 109
their 2
actions 1
may 49
be 1200
rendered 1
ridiculous 4
by 57
a 6799
person 33
whose 1
first 8
object 26
in 2719
life 44
is 124
a 6799
joke 8
certainly 1
replied 1
elizabeth 5
there 21
are 12
such 2
people 4
but 82
i 4330
hope 16
i 4330
am 392
not 85
one 19
of 109
them 9
i 4330
hope 16
i 4330
never 3
ridicule 4
what 14
is 124
wise 17
and 51
good 28
follies 1
and 51
nonsense 2
whims 8
and 51
inconsistencies 1
do 814
divert 6
me 1041
i 4330
own 9
and 51
i 4330
laugh 14
at 272
them 9
whenever 1
i 4330
can 287
but 82
these 4
i 4330
suppose 4
are 12
precisely 1
what 14
you 29
are 12
without 1
perhaps 1
that 11
is 124
not 85
possible 3
for 484
anyone 2
but 82
it 67
has 41
been 1
the 193
study 3
of 109
my 90
life 44
to 805
avoid 8
those 1
weaknesses 1
which 2
often 4
expose 4
a 6799
strong 16
understanding 4
to 805
ridicule 4
such 2
as 509
vanity 2
and 51
pride 6
yes 16
vanity 2
is 124
a 6799
weakness 3
indeed 1
but 82
pride 6
where 21
there 21
is 124
a 6799
real 47
superiority 2
of 109
mind 25
pride 6
will 39
be 1200
always 1
under 288
good 28
regulation 3

away 1

hide 18
a 6799
smile 7
your 4
examination 3
of 109
mr 5
darcy 2
is 124
over 596
i 4330
presume 3
said 1
miss 71
and 51
pray 9
what 14
is 124
the 193
result 8
i 4330
am 392
perfectly 1
convinced 1
by 57
it 67
that 11
mr 5
darcy 2
has 41
no 896
defect 17
he 962
owns 1
it 67
himself 1
without 1
disguise 4
no 896
said 1
darcy 2
i 4330
have 11
made 13
no 896
such 2
pretension 3
i 4330
have 11
faults 1
enough 2
but 82
they 5
are 12
not 85
i 4330
hope 16
of 109
understanding 4
my 90
temper 22
i 4330
dare 15
not 85
vouch 11
for 484
it 67
is 124
i 4330
believe 6
too 50
little 6
yielding 2
certainly 1
too 50
little 6
for 484
the 193
convenience 3
of 109
the 193
world 12
i 4330
cannot 1
forget 8
the 193
follies 1
and 51
vices 1
of 109
others 1
so 797
soon 3
as 509
i 4330
ought 2
nor 102
their 2
offenses 1
against 1
myself 1
my 90
feelings 1
are 12
not 85
puffed 1
about 1
with 34
every 10
attempt 5
to 805
move 10
them 9
my 90
temper 22
would 5
perhaps 1
be 1200
called 1
resentful 4
my 90
good 28
opinion 4
once 2
lost 1
is 124
lost 1
forever 3
that 11
is 124
a 6799
failing 3
indeed 1
cried 1
elizabeth 5
implacable 1
resentment 3
is 124
a 6799
shade 4
in 2719
a 6799
character 16
but 82
you 29
have 11
chosen 1
your 4
fault 20
well 24
i 4330
really 1
cannot 1
laugh 14
at 272
it 67
you 29
are 12
safe 20
from 2
me 1041
there 21
is 124
i 4330
believe 6
in 2719
every 10
disposition 3
a 6799
tendency 2
to 805
some 30
particular 13
evil 15
a 6799
natural 18
defect 17
which 2
not 85
even 36
the 193
best 37
education 9
can 287
overcome 2
and 51
your 4
defect 17
is 124
to 805
hate 14
everybody 2
and 51
yours 3
he 962
replied 1
with 34
a 6799
smile 7
is 124
willfully 1
to 805
misunderstand 5
them 9
do 814
let 50
us 70
have 11
a 6799
little 6
music 24
cried 1
miss 71
tired 6
of 109
a 6799
conversation 8
in 2719
which 2
she 199
had 11
no 896
share 22
louisa 2
you 29
will 39
not 85
mind 25
my 90
waking 2
mr 5
hurst 2
her 181
sister 9
had 11
not 85
the 193
smallest 1
objection 5
and 51
the 193
pianoforte 3
was 93
opened 1
and 51
darcy 2
after 48
a 6799
few 6
recollection 3
was 93
not 85
sorry 1
for 484
it 67
he 962
began 1
to 805
feel 11
the 193
danger 7
of 109
paying 1
elizabeth 5
too 50
much 2
attention 3
chapter 3
in 2719
consequence 3
of 109
an 970
agreement 3
between 1
the 193
sisters 1
elizabeth 5
wrote 1
the 193
next 2
morning 3
to 805
their 2
mother 21
to 805
beg 59
that 11
the 193
carriage 5
might 9
be 1200
sent 35
for 484
them 9
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
the 193
day 27
but 82
mrs 1
bennet 1
who 79
had 11
calculated 2
on 86
her 181
daughters 1
remaining 1
at 272
till 14
the 193
following 3
tuesday 3
which 2
would 5
exactly 1
finish 8
week 20
could 2
not 85
bring 6
herself 1
to 805
receive 8
them 9
with 34
pleasure 5
before 2
her 181
answer 8
therefore 1
was 93
not 85
propitious 2
at 272
least 3
not 85
to 805
elizabeth's 1
wishes 1
for 484
she 199
was 93
impatient 2
to 805
get 13
home 90
mrs 1
bennet 1
sent 35
them 9
word 26
that 11
they 5
could 2
not 85
possibly 1
have 11
the 193
carriage 5
before 2
tuesday 3
and 51
in 2719
her 181
postscript 3
it 67
was 93
added 1
that 11
if 8
mr 5
and 51
his 43
sister 9
pressed 1
them 9
to 805
stay 7
longer 1
she 199
could 2
spare 11
them 9
very 1
well 24
against 1
staying 1
longer 1
however 1
elizabeth 5
was 93
positively 1
resolved 1
nor 102
did 23
she 199
much 2
expect 20
it 67
would 5
be 1200
asked 1
and 51
fearful 4
on 86
the 193
contrary 2
as 509
being 3
considered 1
as 509
intruding 1
themselves 1
needlessly 1
long 49
she 199
urged 1
jane 8
to 805
borrow 9
mr 5
carriage 5
immediately 1
and 51
at 272
length 14
it 67
was 93
settled 1
that 11
their 2
original 6
design 16
of 109
leaving 3
that 11
morning 3
should 7
be 1200
mentioned 1
and 51
the 193
request 6
made 13
the 193
communication 3
excited 2
many 2
professions 1
of 109
concern 6
and 51
enough 2
was 93
said 1
of 109
wishing 1
them 9
to 805
stay 7
at 272
least 3
till 14
the 193
following 3
day 27
to 805
work 87
on 86
jane 8
and 51
till 14
the 193
morrow 3
their 2
going 3
was 93
deferred 1
miss 71
was 93
then 5
sorry 1
that 11
she 199
had 11
proposed 1
the 193
delay 8
for 484
her 181
jealousy 2
and 51
dislike 4
of 109
one 19
sister 9
much 2
exceeded 1
her 181
affection 5
for 484
the 193
other 5
the 193
master 28
of 109
the 193
house 87
heard 1
with 34
real 47
sorrow 9
that 11
they 5
were 5
to 805
go 500
so 797
soon 3
and 51
repeatedly 1
tried 1
to 805
persuade 6
miss 71
bennet 1
that 11
it 67
would 5
not 85
be 1200
safe 20
for 484
her 181
that 11
she 199
was 93
not 85
enough 2
recovered 1
but 82
jane 8
was 93
firm 16
where 21
she 199
felt 5
herself 1
to 805
be 1200
right 31
to 805
mr 5
darcy 2
it 67
was 93
welcome 4
intelligence 2
elizabeth 5
had 11
been 1
at 272
long 49
enough 2
she 199
attracted 1
him 9
more 11
than 22
he 962
liked 1
and 51
miss 71
was 93
uncivil 3
to 805
her 181
and 51
more 11
teasing 2
than 22
usual 3
to 805
himself 1
he 962
wisely 1
resolved 1
to 805
be 1200
particularly 1
careful 6
that 11
no 896
sign 70
of 109
admiration 2
should 7
now 10
escape 10
him 9
nothing 5
that 11
could 2
elevate 3
her 181
with 34
the 193
hope 16
of 109
influencing 1
his 43
felicity 2
sensible 3
that 11
if 8
such 2
an 970
idea 21
had 11
been 1
suggested 1
his 43
during 1
the 193
last 7
day 27
must 28
have 11
material 17
weight 21
in 2719
confirming 1
or 333
crushing 2
it 67
steady 3
to 805
his 43
purpose 12
he 962
scarcely 1
spoke 14
ten 151
words 5
to 805
her 181
through 4
the 193
whole 26
of 109
saturday 3
and 51
though 12
they 5
were 5
at 272
one 19
time 45
left 19
by 57
themselves 1
for 484
half 23
an 970
hour 10
he 962
adhered 1
most 3
conscientiously 1
to 805
his 43
book 69
and 51
would 5
not 85
even 36
look 14
at 272
her 181
on 86
sunday 3
after 48
morning 3
service 13
the 193
separation 3
so 797
agreeable 3
to 805
almost 1
all 162
took 1
place 29
miss 71
civility 2
to 805
elizabeth 5
increased 1
at 272
last 7
very 1
rapidly 1
as 509
well 24
as 509
her 181
affection 5
for 484
jane 8
and 51
when 6
they 5
parted 1
after 48
assuring 1
the 193
latter 3
of 109
the 193
pleasure 5
it 67
would 5
always 1
give 15
her 181
to 805
see 70
her 181
either 1
at 272
or 333
and 51
embracing 1
her 181
most 3
tenderly 1
she 199
even 36
shook 1
hands 24
with 34
the 193
former 3
elizabeth 5
took 1
leave 14
of 109
the 193
whole 26
party 3
in 2719
the 193
liveliest 1
of 109
spirits 1
they 5
were 5
not 85
welcomed 1
home 90
very 1
cordially 1
by 57
their 2
mother 21
mrs 1
bennet 1
wondered 1
at 272
their 2
coming 3
and 51
thought 11
them 9
very 1
wrong 24
to 805
give 15
so 797
much 2
trouble 18
and 51
was 93
sure 11
jane 8
would 5
have 11
caught 1
cold 9
again 2
but 82
their 2
father 12
though 12
very 1
laconic 2
in 2719
his 43
expressions 1
of 109
pleasure 5
was 93
really 1
glad 30
to 805
see 70
them 9
he 962
had 11
felt 5
their 2
importance 2
in 2719
the 193
family 2
circle 7
the 193
evening 3
conversation 8
when 6
they 5
were 5
all 162
assembled 1
had 11
lost 1
much 2
of 109
its 2
animation 3
and 51
almost 1
all 162
its 2
sense 8
by 57
the 193
absence 3
of 109
jane 8
and 51
elizabeth 5
they 5
found 18
mary 13
as 509
usual 3
deep 12
in 2719
the 193
study 3
of 109
thorough 13
bass 26
and 51
human 41
nature 3
and 51
had 11
some 30
extracts 1
to 805
admire 6
and 51
some 30
new 115
observations 1
of 109
threadbare 1
morality 2
to 805
listen 9
to 805
catherine 2
and 51
lydia 4
had 11
information 3
for 484
them 9
of 109
a 6799
different 11
sort 14
much 2
had 11
been 1
done 3
and 51
much 2
had 11
been 1
said 1
in 2719
the 193
regiment 8
since 7
the 193
preceding 1
wednesday 3
several 3
of 109
the 193
officers 1
had 11
dined 1
lately 1
with 34
their 2
uncle 18
a 6799
private 9

been 1
flogged 1

it 67

morning 3
that 11

ordered 1
a 6799
good 28
dinner 9
to 805

addition 5
to 805

of 109

sure 11
unless 1
charlotte 4
lucas 1
should 7
happen 9
to 805
call 57
in 2719
and 51
i 4330
hope 16
my 90
dinners 1
are 12
good 28
enough 2
for 484
her 181
i 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
she 199
often 4
sees 6
such 2
at 272
home 90
the 193
person 33
of 109
whom 3
i 4330
speak 12

a 6799
gentleman 3
and 51
a 6799
stranger 3

be 1200
extremely 1
glad 30
to 805
see 70
mr 5
but 82
good 28
lord 13
how 27
unlucky 1
there 21
is 124
not 85
a 6799
bit 48
of 109
fish 46
to 805
be 1200
got 14
to 805
day 27
lydia 4
my 90
love 29
ring 30
the 193
bell 66
i 4330
must 28
speak 12
to 805
hill 22
this 6
moment 14
it 67
is 124
not 85
mr 5
said 1
her 181
husband 10
it 67
is 124
a 6799
person 33
whom 3
i 4330
never 3
saw 24
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
course 10
of 109
my 90
life 44
this 6
roused 1
a 6799
general 22
astonishment 2
and 51
he 962
had 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
being 3
eagerly 1
questioned 1
by 57
his 43
wife 6
and 51
his 43
five 5
daughters 1
at 272
once 2
after 48
amusing 2
himself 1
some 30
time 45
with 34
their 2
curiosity 2
he 962
thus 1
explained 1
about 1
a 6799
month 6
ago 15
i 4330
received 1
this 6
letter 20
and 51
about 1
a 6799
fortnight 4
ago 15
i 4330
answered 1
it 67
for 484
i 4330
thought 11
it 67
a 6799
case 25
of 109
some 30
delicacy 2
and 51
requiring 1
early 1
attention 3
it 67
is 124
from 2
my 90
cousin 3
mr 5
collins 1
who 79
when 6
i 4330
am 392
dead 39
may 49
turn 46
you 29
all 162
out 365
of 109
this 6
house 87
as 509
soon 3
as 509
he 962
pleases 1
oh 17
my 90
dear 15
cried 1
his 43
wife 6
i 4330
cannot 1
bear 30
to 805
hear 76
that 11
mentioned 1
pray 9
do 814
not 85
talk 18
of 109
that 11
odious 4
man 342
i 4330
do 814
think 8
it 67
is 124
the 193
hardest 1
thing 15
in 2719
the 193
world 12
that 11
your 4
estate 3
should 7
be 1200
entailed 1
away 1
from 2
your 4
own 9
children 1
and 51
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
if 8
i 4330
had 11
been 1
you 29
i 4330
should 7
have 11
tried 1
long 49
ago 15
to 805
do 814
something 3
or 333
other 5
about 1
it 67
jane 8
and 51
elizabeth 5
tried 1
to 805
explain 5
to 805
her 181
the 193
nature 3
of 109
an 970
entail 6
they 5
had 11
often 4
attempted 1
to 805
do 814
it 67
before 2
but 82
it 67
was 93
a 6799
subject 11
on 86
which 2
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
beyond 1
the 193
reach 6
of 109
reason 13
and 51
she 199
continued 1
to 805
rail 26
bitterly 1
against 1
the 193
cruelty 2
of 109
settling 1
an 970
estate 3
away 1
from 2
a 6799
family 2
of 109
five 5
daughters 1
in 2719
of 109
a 6799
man 342
whom 3
nobody 2
cared 1
anything 3
about 1
it 67
certainly 1
is 124
a 6799
most 3
iniquitous 2
affair 3
said 1
mr 5
bennet 1
and 51
nothing 5
can 287
clear 23
mr 5
collins 1
from 2
the 193
guilt 9
of 109
inheriting 1
but 82
if 8
you 29
will 39
listen 9
to 805
his 43
letter 20
you 29
may 49
perhaps 1
be 1200
a 6799
little 6
softened 1
by 57
his 43
manner 8
of 109
expressing 1
himself 1
no 896
that 11
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
i 4330
shall 12
not 85
and 51
i 4330
think 8
it 67
is 124
very 1
impertinent 2
of 109
him 9
to 805
write 5
to 805
you 29
at 272
all 162
and 51
very 1
hypocritical 2
i 4330
hate 14
such 2
false 12
friends 4
why 4
could 2
he 962
not 85
keep 11
on 86
quarreling 1
with 34
you 29
as 509
his 43
father 12
did 23
before 2
him 9
why 4
indeed 1
he 962
does 5
seem 10
to 805
have 11
had 11
some 30
filial 1
scruples 1
on 86
that 11
head 140
as 509
you 29
will 39
hear 76
near 15
kent 9
th 736
october 3
dear 15
sir 22
the 193
disagreement 3
subsisting 1
between 1
yourself 1
and 51
my 90
late 23
father 12
always 1
gave 4
me 1041
much 2
uneasiness 2
and 51
since 7
i 4330
have 11
had 11
the 193
misfortune 3
to 805
lose 5
him 9
i 4330
have 11
frequently 1
wished 1
to 805
heal 19
the 193
breach 5
but 82
for 484
some 30
time 45
i 4330
was 93
kept 1
back 182
by 57
my 90
own 9
doubts 1
fearing 1
lest 5
it 67
might 9
seem 10
disrespectful 2
to 805
his 43
memory 2
for 484
me 1041
to 805
be 1200
on 86
good 28
terms 1
with 34
anyone 2
with 34
whom 3
it 67
had 11
always 1
pleased 1
him 9
to 805
be 1200
at 272
variance 3
mrs 1
bennet 1
my 90
mind 25
however 1
is 124
now 10
made 13
up 194
on 86
the 193
subject 11
for 484
having 1
received 1
ordination 3
at 272
easter 11
i 4330
have 11
been 1
so 797
fortunate 2
as 509
to 805
be 1200
distinguished 1
by 57
the 193
patronage 3
of 109
the 193
right 31
lady 18
catherine 2
de 2452
widow 10
of 109
sir 22
lewis 1
de 2452
whose 1
bounty 2
and 51
beneficence 2
has 41
preferred 1
me 1041
to 805
the 193
valuable 3
rectory 2
of 109
this 6
parish 6
where 21
it 67
shall 12
be 1200
my 90
earnest 8
to 805
demean 6
myself 1
with 34
grateful 4
respect 18
towards 1
her 181
ladyship 3
and 51
be 1200
ever 33
ready 2
to 805
perform 10
those 1
rites 1
and 51
ceremonies 1
which 2
are 12
instituted 1
by 57
the 193
church 21
of 109
england 2
as 509
a 6799
clergyman 2
moreover 1
i 4330
feel 11
it 67
my 90
duty 2
to 805
promote 6
and 51
establish 7
the 193
blessing 3
of 109
peace 21
in 2719
all 162
families 1
within 3
the 193
reach 6
of 109
my 90
influence 4
and 51
on 86
these 4
grounds 10
i 4330
flatter 10
myself 1
that 11
my 90
present 20
overtures 1
are 12
highly 1
commendable 1
and 51
that 11
the 193
circumstance 4
of 109
my 90
being 3
next 2
in 2719
the 193
entail 6
of 109
estate 3
will 39
be 1200
kindly 1
overlooked 1
on 86
your 4
side 74
and 51
not 85
lead 15
you 29
to 805
reject 8
the 193
offered 1
olive 6
branch 6
i 4330
cannot 1
be 1200
otherwise 1
than 22
concerned 2
at 272
being 3
the 193
means 1
of 109
injuring 1
your 4
amiable 1
daughters 1
and 51
beg 59
leave 14
to 805
for 484
it 67
as 509
well 24
as 509
to 805
assure 6
you 29
of 109
my 90
readiness 2
to 805
make 17
them 9
every 10
possible 3
amends 1
but 82
of 109
this 6
hereafter 3
if 8
you 29
should 7
have 11
no 896
objection 5
to 805
receive 8
me 1041
into 26
your 4
house 87
i 4330
propose 6
myself 1
the 193
satisfaction 3
of 109
waiting 2
on 86
you 29
and 51
your 4
family 2
monday 3
november 3
th 736
by 57
four 26
o'clock 1
and 51
shall 12
probably 1
trespass 8
on 86
your 4
hospitality 2
till 14
the 193
saturday 3
following 3
which 2
i 4330
can 287
do 814
without 1
any 17
inconvenience 4
as 509
lady 18
catherine 2
is 124
far 91
from 2
objecting 1
to 805
my 90
occasional 2
absence 3
on 86
a 6799
sunday 3
provided 1
that 11
some 30
other 5
clergyman 2
is 124
engaged 1
to 805
do 814
the 193
duty 2
of 109
the 193
day 27
i 4330
remain 9
dear 15
sir 22
with 34
respectful 4
compliments 1
to 805
your 4
lady 18
and 51
daughters 1
your 4
well 24
wisher 3
and 51
friend 14
william 3
collins 1
at 272
four 26
o'clock 1
therefore 1
we 444
may 49
expect 20
this 6
peace 21
making 4
gentleman 3
said 1
mr 5
bennet 1
as 509
he 962
folded 1
up 194
the 193
letter 20
he 962
seems 1
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
most 3
conscientious 4
and 51
polite 8
young 9
man 342
upon 1
my 90
word 26
and 51
i 4330
doubt 15
not 85
will 39
prove 21
a 6799
valuable 3
acquaintance 5
especially 1
if 8
lady 18
catherine 2
should 7
be 1200
so 797
indulgent 2
as 509
to 805
let 50
him 9
come 36
to 805
us 70
again 2
there 21
is 124
some 30
sense 8
in 2719
what 14
he 962
says 1
about 1
the 193
girls 1
however 1
and 51
if 8
he 962
is 124
disposed 1
to 805
make 17
them 9
any 17
amends 1
i 4330
shall 12
not 85
be 1200
the 193
person 33
to 805
discourage 6
him 9
though 12
it 67
is 124
difficult 5
said 1
jane 8
to 805
guess 16
in 2719
what 14
way 27
he 962
can 287
mean 36
to 805
make 17
us 70
the 193
atonement 2
he 962
thinks 1
our 3
due 21
the 193
wish 13
is 124
certainly 1
to 805
his 43
credit 12
elizabeth 5
was 93
chiefly 1
struck 1
by 57
his 43
extraordinary 1
deference 2
for 484
lady 18
catherine 2
and 51
his 43
kind 31
intention 5
of 109
christening 3
marrying 1
and 51
burying 1
his 43
parishioners 1
whenever 1
it 67
were 5
required 1
he 962
must 28
be 1200
an 970
oddity 2
i 4330
think 8
said 1
she 199
i 4330
cannot 1
make 17
him 9
out 365
there 21
is 124
something 3
very 1
pompous 4
in 2719
his 43
style 4
and 51
what 14
can 287
he 962
mean 36
by 57
for 484
being 3
next 2
in 2719
the 193
entail 6
we 444
cannot 1
suppose 4
he 962
would 5
help 23
it 67
if 8
he 962
could 2
could 2
he 962
be 1200
a 6799
sensible 3
man 342
sir 22
no 896
my 90
dear 15
i 4330
think 8
not 85
i 4330
have 11
great 12
hopes 1
of 109
finding 4
him 9
quite 1
the 193
reverse 5
there 21
is 124
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109
servility 2
and 51
self 11
importance 2
in 2719
his 43
letter 20
which 2
promises 1
well 24
i 4330
am 392
impatient 2
to 805
see 70
him 9
in 2719
point 22
of 109
composition 3
said 1
mary 13
the 193
letter 20
does 5
not 85
seem 10
defective 6
the 193
idea 21
of 109
the 193
olive 6
branch 6
perhaps 1
is 124
not 85
wholly 1
new 115
yet 4
i 4330
think 8
it 67
is 124
well 24
expressed 1
to 805
catherine 2
and 51
lydia 4
neither 1
the 193
letter 20
nor 102
its 2
writer 3
were 5
in 2719
any 17
degree 3
interesting 2
it 67
was 93
next 2
to 805
impossible 2
that 11
their 2
cousin 3
should 7
come 36
in 2719
a 6799
scarlet 2
coat 12
and 51
it 67
was 93
now 10
some 30
weeks 2
since 7
they 5
had 11
received 1
pleasure 5
from 2
the 193
society 2
of 109
a 6799
man 342
in 2719
any 17
other 5
as 509
for 484
their 2
mother 21
mr 5
letter 20
had 11
done 3
away 1
much 2
of 109
her 181
ill 84
will 39
and 51
she 199
was 93
preparing 1
to 805
see 70
him 9
with 34
a 6799
degree 3
of 109
composure 2
which 2
astonished 1
her 181
husband 10
and 51
daughters 1
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
punctual 4
to 805
his 43
time 45
and 51
was 93
received 1
with 34
great 12
politeness 2
by 57
the 193
whole 26
family 2
mr 5
bennet 1
indeed 1
said 1
little 6
but 82
the 193
ladies 1
were 5
ready 2
enough 2
to 805
talk 18
and 51
mr 5
collins 1
seemed 1
neither 1
in 2719
need 29
of 109
encouragement 3
nor 102
inclined 1
to 805
be 1200
silent 6
himself 1
he 962
was 93
a 6799
tall 35
heavy 7
looking 1
young 9
man 342
of 109
five 5
and 51
twenty 2
his 43
air 129
was 93
grave 28
and 51
stately 1
and 51
his 43
manners 1
were 5
very 1
formal 21
he 962
had 11
not 85
been 1
long 49
seated 1
before 2
he 962
complimented 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
on 86
having 1
so 797
fine 17
a 6799
family 2
of 109
daughters 1
said 1
he 962
had 11
heard 1
much 2
of 109
their 2
beauty 2
but 82
that 11
in 2719
this 6
instance 4
fame 3
had 11
fallen 1
short 62
of 109
the 193
truth 7
and 51
added 1
that 11
he 962
did 23
not 85
doubt 15
her 181
seeing 2
them 9
all 162
in 2719
due 21
time 45
disposed 1
of 109
in 2719
marriage 6
this 6
gallantry 2
was 93
not 85
much 2
to 805
the 193
taste 15
of 109
some 30
of 109
his 43
hearers 1
but 82
mrs 1
bennet 1
who 79
quarreled 1
with 34
no 896
compliments 1
answered 1
most 3
readily 1
you 29
are 12
very 1
kind 31
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
and 51
i 4330
wish 13
with 34
all 162
my 90
heart 57
it 67
may 49
prove 21
so 797
for 484
else 2
they 5
will 39
be 1200
destitute 1
enough 2
things 1
are 12
settled 1
so 797
oddly 1
you 29
allude 3
perhaps 1
to 805
the 193
entail 6
of 109
this 6
estate 3
ah 17
sir 22
i 4330
do 814
indeed 1
it 67
is 124
a 6799
grievous 4
affair 3
to 805
my 90
poor 11
girls 1
you 29
must 28
confess 14
not 85
that 11
i 4330
mean 36
to 805
find 10
fault 20
with 34
you 29
for 484
such 2
things 1
i 4330
know 12
are 12
all 162
chance 20
in 2719
this 6
world 12
there 21
is 124
no 896
knowing 3
how 27
estates 1
will 39
go 500
when 6
once 2
they 5
come 36
to 805
be 1200
entailed 1
i 4330
am 392
very 1
sensible 3
madam 5
of 109
the 193
hardship 3
to 805
my 90
fair 25
cousins 1
and 51
could 2
say 7
much 2
on 86
the 193
subject 11
but 82
that 11
i 4330
am 392
cautious 4
of 109
appearing 1
forward 12
and 51
precipitate 5
but 82
i 4330
can 287
assure 6
the 193
young 9
ladies 1
that 11
i 4330
come 36
prepared 3
to 805
admire 6
them 9
at 272
present 20
i 4330
will 39
not 85
say 7
more 11
but 82
perhaps 1
when 6
we 444
are 12
better 7
acquainted 1
he 962
was 93
interrupted 1
by 57
a 6799
summons 5
to 805
dinner 9
and 51
the 193
girls 1
smiled 1
on 86
each 1
other 5
they 5
were 5
not 85
the 193
only 1
objects 1
of 109
mr 5
admiration 2
the 193
hall 45
the 193
dining 1
room 22
and 51
all 162
its 2
furniture 2
were 5
examined 1
and 51
praised 1
and 51
his 43
commendation 3
of 109
everything 2
would 5
have 11
touched 1
mrs 1
heart 57
but 82
for 484
the 193
mortifying 1
supposition 3
of 109
his 43
viewing 3
it 67
all 162
as 509
his 43
own 9
future 3
property 2
the 193
dinner 9
too 50
in 2719
its 2
turn 46
was 93
highly 1
admired 1
and 51
he 962
begged 1
to 805
know 12
to 805
which 2
of 109
his 43
fair 25
cousins 1
the 193
excellency 2
of 109
its 2
cooking 2
was 93
owing 1
but 82
he 962
was 93
set 40
right 31
there 21
by 57
mrs 1
bennet 1
who 79
assured 4
him 9
with 34
some 30
asperity 2
that 11
they 5
were 5
very 1
well 24
able 3
to 805
keep 11
a 6799
good 28
cook 28
and 51
that 11
her 181
daughters 1
had 11
nothing 5
to 805
do 814
in 2719
the 193
kitchen 9
he 962
begged 1
pardon 10
for 484
having 1
displeased 1
her 181
in 2719
a 6799
softened 1
tone 12
she 199
declared 1
herself 1
not 85
at 272
all 162
offended 1
but 82
he 962
continued 1
to 805
for 484
about 1
a 6799
quarter 25
of 109
an 970
hour 10
chapter 3
during 1
dinner 9
mr 5
bennet 1
scarcely 1
spoke 14
at 272
all 162
but 82
when 6
the 193
servants 1
were 5
withdrawn 1
he 962
thought 11
it 67
time 45
to 805
have 11
some 30
conversation 8
with 34
his 43
guest 9
and 51
therefore 1
started 1
a 6799
subject 11
in 2719
which 2
he 962
expected 1
him 9
to 805
shine 7
by 57
observing 1
that 11
he 962
seemed 1
very 1
fortunate 2
in 2719
his 43
patroness 3
lady 18
catherine 2
de 2452
attention 3
to 805
his 43
wishes 1
and 51
consideration 3
for 484
his 43
comfort 14
appeared 1
very 1
remarkable 3
mr 5
bennet 1
could 2
not 85
have 11
chosen 1
better 7
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
eloquent 2
in 2719
her 181
praise 7
the 193
subject 11
elevated 1
him 9
to 805
more 11
than 22
usual 3
solemnity 2
of 109
manner 8
and 51
with 34
a 6799
most 3
important 2
aspect 3
he 962
protested 1
that 11
he 962
had 11
never 3
in 2719
his 43
life 44
witnessed 1
such 2
in 2719
a 6799
person 33
of 109
rank 19
such 2
affability 2
and 51
condescension 2
as 509
he 962
had 11
himself 1
experienced 1
from 2
lady 18
catherine 2
she 199
had 11
been 1
graciously 1
pleased 1
to 805
approve 3
of 109
both 8
of 109
the 193
discourses 1
which 2
he 962
had 11
already 1
had 11
the 193
of 109
preaching 1
before 2
her 181
she 199
had 11
also 3
asked 1
him 9
twice 1
to 805
dine 9
at 272
and 51
had 11
sent 35
for 484
him 9
only 1
the 193
saturday 3
before 2
to 805
make 17
up 194
her 181
pool 12
of 109
quadrille 3
in 2719
the 193
evening 3
lady 18
catherine 2
was 93
reckoned 1
proud 5
by 57
many 2
people 4
he 962
knew 1
but 82
he 962
had 11
never 3
seen 1
anything 3
but 82
affability 2
in 2719
her 181
she 199
had 11
always 1
spoken 1
to 805
him 9
as 509
she 199
would 5
to 805
any 17
other 5
gentleman 3
she 199
made 13
not 85
the 193
smallest 1
objection 5
to 805
his 43
joining 1
in 2719
the 193
society 2
of 109
the 193
nor 102
to 805
his 43
leaving 3
the 193
parish 6
occasionally 1
for 484
a 6799
week 20
or 333
two 14
to 805
visit 14
his 43
relations 4
she 199
had 11
even 36
condescended 1
to 805
advise 9
him 9
to 805
marry 2
as 509
soon 3
as 509
he 962
could 2
provided 1
he 962
chose 2
with 34
discretion 3
and 51
had 11
once 2
paid 1
him 9
a 6799
visit 14
in 2719
his 43
humble 9
parsonage 3
where 21
she 199
had 11
perfectly 1
approved 1
all 162
the 193
alterations 1
he 962
had 11
been 1
making 4
and 51
had 11
even 36
vouchsafed 1
to 805
suggest 15
some 30
herself 1
some 30
shelves 1
in 2719
the 193
closet 5
up 194
stairs 1
that 11
is 124
all 162
very 1
proper 9
and 51
civil 15
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
said 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
and 51
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
she 199
is 124
a 6799
very 1
agreeable 3
woman 21
it 67
is 124
a 6799
pity 4
that 11
great 12
ladies 1
in 2719
general 22
are 12
not 85
more 11
like 22
her 181
does 5
she 199
live 43
near 15
you 29
sir 22
the 193
garden 12
in 2719
which 2
stands 4
my 90
humble 9
abode 3
is 124
separated 1
only 1
by 57
a 6799
lane 3
from 2
park 18
her 181
ladyship's 1
residence 3
i 4330
think 8
you 29
said 1
she 199
was 93
a 6799
widow 10
sir 22
has 41
she 199
any 17
family 2
she 199
has 41
only 1
one 19
daughter 4
the 193
heiress 3
of 109
and 51
of 109
very 1
extensive 4
property 2
ah 17
said 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
shaking 1
her 181
head 140
then 5
she 199
is 124
better 7
off 100
than 22
many 2
girls 1
and 51
what 14
sort 14
of 109
young 9
lady 18
is 124
she 199
is 124
she 199
handsome 6
she 199
is 124
a 6799
most 3
charming 2
young 9
lady 18
indeed 1
lady 18
catherine 2
herself 1
says 1
that 11
in 2719
point 22
of 109
true 9
beauty 2
miss 71
de 2452
is 124
far 91
superior 5
to 805
the 193
handsomest 1
of 109
her 181
sex 45
because 1
there 21
is 124
that 11
in 2719
her 181
features 1
which 2
marks 6
the 193
young 9
lady 18
of 109
distinguished 1
birth 23
she 199
is 124
unfortunately 1
of 109
a 6799
sickly 1
constitution 10
which 2
has 41
prevented 1
her 181
from 2
making 4
that 11
progress 14
in 2719
many 2
accomplishments 1
which 2
she 199
could 2
not 85
have 11
otherwise 1
failed 1
of 109
as 509
i 4330
am 392
informed 1
by 57
the 193
lady 18
who 79
superintended 1
her 181
education 9
and 51
who 79
still 13
resides 1
with 34
them 9
but 82
she 199
is 124
perfectly 1
amiable 1
and 51
often 4
condescends 1
to 805
drive 18
by 57
my 90
humble 9
abode 3
in 2719
her 181
little 6
phaeton 3
and 51
ponies 1
has 41
she 199
been 1
presented 1
i 4330
do 814
not 85
remember 4
her 181
name 17
among 1
the 193
ladies 1
at 272
court 37
her 181
indifferent 2
state 41
of 109
health 12
unhappily 1
prevents 1
her 181
being 3
in 2719
town 27
and 51
by 57
that 11
means 1
as 509
i 4330
told 1
lady 18
catherine 2
one 19
day 27
has 41
deprived 1
the 193
british 5
court 37
of 109
its 2
brightest 1
ornament 8
her 181
ladyship 3
seemed 1
pleased 1
with 34
the 193
idea 21
and 51
you 29
may 49
imagine 3
that 11
i 4330
am 392
happy 1
on 86
every 10
occasion 7
to 805
offer 10
those 1
little 6
delicate 7
compliments 1
which 2
are 12
always 1
acceptable 3
to 805
ladies 1
i 4330
have 11
more 11
than 22
once 2
observed 1
to 805
lady 18
catherine 2
that 11
her 181
charming 2
daughter 4
seemed 1
born 4
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
duchess 3
and 51
that 11
the 193
most 3
elevated 1
rank 19
instead 1
of 109
giving 2
her 181
consequence 3
would 5
be 1200
adorned 1
by 57
her 181
these 4
are 12
the 193
kind 31
of 109
little 6
things 1
which 2
please 3
her 181
ladyship 3
and 51
it 67
is 124
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
attention 3
which 2
i 4330
conceive 3
myself 1
peculiarly 1
bound 16
to 805
pay 52
you 29
judge 6
very 1
properly 1
said 1
mr 5
bennet 1
and 51
it 67
is 124
happy 1
for 484
you 29
that 11
you 29
possess 16
the 193
talent 4
of 109
flattering 2
with 34
delicacy 2
may 49
i 4330
ask 6
whether 1
these 4
pleasing 3
attentions 1
proceed 7
from 2
the 193
impulse 4
of 109
the 193
moment 14
or 333
are 12
the 193
result 8
of 109
previous 2
study 3
they 5
arise 3
chiefly 1
from 2
what 14
is 124
passing 3
at 272
the 193
time 45
and 51
though 12
i 4330
sometimes 1
amuse 6
myself 1
with 34
suggesting 1
and 51
arranging 1
such 2
little 6
elegant 2
compliments 1
as 509
may 49
be 1200
adapted 1
to 805
ordinary 2
occasions 1
i 4330
always 1
wish 13
to 805
give 15
them 9
as 509
unstudied 1
an 970
air 129
as 509
possible 3
mr 5
expectations 1
were 5
fully 1
answered 1
his 43
cousin 3
was 93
as 509
absurd 9
as 509
he 962
had 11
hoped 1
and 51
he 962
listened 1
to 805
him 9
with 34
the 193
keenest 1
enjoyment 3
maintaining 1
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
the 193
most 3
resolute 4
composure 2
of 109
countenance 4
and 51
except 10
in 2719
an 970
occasional 2
glance 4
at 272
elizabeth 5
requiring 1
no 896
partner 8
in 2719
his 43
pleasure 5
by 57
tea 99
time 45
however 1
the 193
dose 4
had 11
been 1
enough 2
and 51
mr 5
bennet 1
was 93
glad 30
to 805
take 18
his 43
guest 9
into 26
the 193
drawing 3
room 22
again 2
and 51
when 6
tea 99
was 93
over 596
glad 30
to 805
invite 7
him 9
to 805
read 49
aloud 1
to 805
the 193
ladies 1
mr 5
collins 1
readily 1
assented 1
and 51
a 6799
book 69
was 93
produced 1
but 82
on 86
beholding 1
it 67
for 484
everything 2
announced 1
it 67
to 805
be 1200
from 2
a 6799
circulating 1
library 2
he 962
started 1
back 182
and 51
begging 1
pardon 10
protested 1
that 11
he 962
never 3
read 49
novels 1
kitty 2
stared 1
at 272
him 9
and 51
lydia 4
exclaimed 1
other 5
books 15
were 5
produced 1
and 51
after 48
some 30
deliberation 3
he 962
chose 2
sermons 1
lydia 4
gaped 1
as 509
he 962
opened 1
the 193
volume 3
and 51
before 2
he 962
had 11
with 34
very 1
monotonous 4
solemnity 2
read 49
three 12
pages 1
she 199
interrupted 1
him 9
with 34
do 814
you 29
know 12
mamma 9
that 11
my 90
uncle 18
phillips 1
talks 1
of 109
turning 3
away 1
richard 3
and 51
if 8
he 962
does 5
colonel 5
forster 1
will 39
hire 7
him 9
my 90
aunt 6
told 1
me 1041
so 797
herself 1
on 86
saturday 3
i 4330
shall 12
walk 25
to 805
to 805
morrow 3
to 805
hear 76
more 11
about 1
it 67
and 51
to 805
ask 6
when 6
mr 5
denny 2
comes 4
back 182
from 2
town 27
lydia 4
was 93
bid 24
by 57
her 181
two 14
eldest 1
sisters 1
to 805
hold 22
her 181
tongue 5
but 82
mr 5
collins 1
much 2
offended 1
laid 1
aside 3
his 43
book 69
and 51
said 1
i 4330
have 11
often 4
observed 1
how 27
little 6
young 9
ladies 1
are 12
interested 1
by 57
books 15
of 109
a 6799
serious 4
stamp 13
though 12
written 1
solely 1
for 484
their 2
benefit 5
it 67
amazes 1
me 1041
i 4330
confess 14
for 484
certainly 1
there 21
can 287
be 1200
nothing 5
so 797
advantageous 2
to 805
them 9
as 509
instruction 4
but 82
i 4330
will 39
no 896
longer 1
importune 3
my 90
young 9
cousin 3
then 5
turning 3
to 805
mr 5
bennet 1
he 962
offered 1
himself 1
as 509
his 43
antagonist 5
at 272
backgammon 2
mr 5
bennet 1
accepted 1
the 193
challenge 7
observing 1
that 11
he 962
acted 1
very 1
wisely 1
in 2719
leaving 3
the 193
girls 1
to 805
their 2
own 9
trifling 1
amusements 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
and 51
her 181
daughters 1
most 3
civilly 1
for 484
interruption 3
and 51
promised 1
that 11
it 67
should 7
not 85
occur 7
again 2

that 11

bore 13
his 43
young 9
cousin 3
no 896

chapter 3
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
not 85
a 6799
sensible 3
man 342
and 51
the 193
deficiency 2
of 109
nature 3
had 11
been 1
but 82
little 6
assisted 1
by 57
education 9
or 333
society 2
the 193
greatest 1
part 102
of 109
his 43
life 44
having 1
been 1
spent 1
under 288
the 193
guidance 2
of 109
an 970
illiterate 4
and 51
miserly 1
father 12
and 51
though 12
he 962
belonged 1
to 805
one 19
of 109
the 193
universities 1
he 962
had 11
merely 1
kept 1
the 193
necessary 2
terms 1
without 1
forming 1
at 272
it 67
any 17
useful 4
acquaintance 5
the 193
subjection 2
in 2719
which 2
his 43
father 12
had 11
brought 1
him 9
up 194
had 11
given 3
him 9
originally 1
great 12
humility 2
of 109
manner 8
but 82
it 67
was 93
now 10
a 6799
good 28
deal 13
counteracted 1
by 57
the 193
self 11
conceit 7
of 109
a 6799
weak 20
head 140
living 5
in 2719
retirement 3
and 51
the 193
consequential 2
feelings 1
of 109
early 1
and 51
unexpected 4
prosperity 2
a 6799
fortunate 2
chance 20
had 11
recommended 1
him 9
to 805
lady 18
catherine 2
de 2452
when 6
the 193
living 5
of 109
was 93
vacant 2
and 51
the 193
respect 18
which 2
he 962
felt 5
for 484
her 181
high 54
rank 19
and 51
his 43
veneration 2
for 484
her 181
as 509
his 43
patroness 3
mingling 1
with 34
a 6799
very 1
good 28
opinion 4
of 109
himself 1
of 109
his 43
authority 2
as 509
a 6799
clergyman 2
and 51
his 43
right 31
as 509
a 6799
rector 6
made 13
him 9
altogether 1
a 6799
mixture 3
of 109
pride 6
and 51
obsequiousness 2
self 11
importance 2
and 51
humility 2
having 1
now 10
a 6799
good 28
house 87
and 51
a 6799
very 1
sufficient 2
income 5
he 962
intended 3
to 805
marry 2
and 51
in 2719
seeking 1
a 6799
reconciliation 3
with 34
the 193
family 2
he 962
had 11
a 6799
wife 6
in 2719
view 18
as 509
he 962
meant 3
to 805
choose 5
one 19
of 109
the 193
daughters 1
if 8
he 962
found 18
them 9
as 509
handsome 6
and 51
amiable 1
as 509
they 5
were 5
represented 1
by 57
common 23
report 12
this 6
was 93
his 43
plan 61
of 109
amends 1
of 109
atonement 2
for 484
inheriting 1
their 2
father's 1
estate 3
and 51
he 962
thought 11
it 67
an 970
excellent 2
one 19
full 16
of 109
eligibility 2
and 51
suitableness 2
and 51
excessively 1
generous 4
and 51
disinterested 4
on 86
his 43
own 9
part 102
his 43
plan 61
did 23
not 85
vary 2
on 86
seeing 2
them 9

confirmed 1
his 43
views 1

established 1
all 162
his 43
strictest 1
notions 1
of 109
what 14
was 93
due 21
to 805
seniority 2

mr 5

was 93
to 805
attend 15
them 9
at 272
the 193
request 6
of 109
mr 5
bennet 1
who 79
was 93
most 3
anxious 4
to 805
get 13
rid 42

have 11
his 43

really 1
talking 1
to 805
mr 5
bennet 1
with 34
little 6
cessation 3
of 109
his 43
house 87
and 51
garden 12
at 272
such 2
doings 1
discomposed 1
mr 5
bennet 1
exceedingly 1
in 2719
his 43
library 2
he 962
had 11
been 1
always 1
sure 11
of 109
leisure 8
and 51
and 51
though 12
prepared 3
as 509
he 962
told 1
elizabeth 5
to 805
meet 9
with 34
folly 2
and 51
conceit 7
in 2719

other 5
room 22

was 93
used 1
to 805
be 1200
free 93
from 2
them 9
there 21
his 43
civility 2
therefore 1
was 93
most 3
prompt 16
in 2719
inviting 2
mr 5
collins 1
to 805
join 16
his 43
daughters 1
in 2719

walk 25
and 51
mr 5
collins 1
being 3
in 2719
fact 35
much 2
better 7
fitted 1
for 484
a 6799
walker 3
than 22
a 6799
reader 6
was 93
extremely 1
pleased 1
to 805
close 22

large 11
book 69

of 109
his 43

time 45
passed 1
till 14
they 5
entered 1
the 193
attention 3
of 109
the 193
younger 1
ones 2
was 93
then 5
no 896
longer 1
to 805
be 1200
gained 1
by 57
him 9
their 2
eyes 8
were 5
immediately 1
wandering 3
up 194
in 2719
the 193
street 15
in 2719
quest 21
of 109
the 193
officers 1
and 51
nothing 5
less 19
than 22
a 6799
very 1
smart 20
bonnet 3
indeed 1
or 333
a 6799
really 1
new 115
muslin 2
in 2719
a 6799
shop 33

could 2
recall 5
them 9
but 82
the 193
attention 3
of 109
every 10
lady 18
was 93
soon 3
caught 1
by 57
a 6799
young 9
man 342
whom 3
they 5
had 11
never 3
seen 1
before 2
of 109
most 3
appearance 3
walking 2

concerning 1
whose 1
return 14
from 2
london 5
lydia 4
came 36
to 805
inquire 6
and 51
he 962
bowed 1
as 509
they 5
passed 1
all 162
were 5
struck 1
with 34
the 193
stranger's 1
air 129
all 162
wondered 1
who 79
he 962
could 2
be 1200
and 51
kitty 2
and 51
lydia 4
determined 2
if 8
possible 3
to 805
find 10
out 365
led 11
the 193

across 1
the 193
street 15
under 288
pretense 3
of 109
wanting 1
something 3
in 2719
an 970
opposite 4
shop 33
and 51
fortunately 1
had 11
just 24
gained 1
the 193
pavement 3
when 6
the 193
two 14
gentlemen 1
turning 3
back 182
had 11
reached 1
the 193
same 5
spot 24

them 9
directly 1
and 51
entreated 1
permission 3
to 805

friend 14
mr 5

had 11
returned 1
with 34
him 9

be 1200

followed 1
up 194
on 86
his 43
side 74
by 57
a 6799
happy 1
readiness 2
of 109

a 6799
readiness 2
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
perfectly 1
correct 18
and 51
unassuming 2
and 51
the 193
whole 26
party 3
were 5
still 13
standing 3
and 51
talking 1
together 3
very 1
agreeably 1
when 6
the 193
sound 29
of 109
horses 7
drew 2
their 2
notice 8
and 51
darcy 2
and 51

seen 1
riding 2
down 90

corroborated 1
it 67
with 34
a 6799
bow 58
and 51
was 93
beginning 3
to 805
determine 7
not 85
to 805
fix 27

eyes 8
on 86
elizabeth 5
when 6
they 5
were 5
suddenly 1
arrested 1
by 57
the 193
sight 17
of 109
the 193
stranger 3
and 51
elizabeth 5
happening 3
to 805

after 48
a 6799
few 6
moments 1
touched 1
his 43
hat 64
a 6799
salutation 3
which 2
mr 5
darcy 2
just 24
deigned 1
to 805
return 14
what 14
could 2
be 1200
the 193
meaning 11
of 109
it 67
it 67
was 93
impossible 2
to 805
imagine 3
it 67
was 93
impossible 2
not 85
to 805
long 49
to 805

in 2719
another 1
minute 12
mr 5

without 1
seeming 2
to 805

noticed 1
what 14
passed 1
took 1
leave 14
and 51
rode 9
on 86
with 34
his 43
friend 14
mr 5
denny 2
and 51
mr 5
walked 1
with 34
the 193
young 9
ladies 1
to 805
the 193
door 41
of 109
mr 5
house 87
and 51
then 5
made 13
their 2
bows 7
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
miss 71
pressing 4
entreaties 1
that 11
they 5
should 7
come 36
in 2719
and 51
even 36
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
mrs 1
throwing 1
up 194
the 193
window 12
and 51
loudly 1
seconding 1
the 193
invitation 6
mrs 1
phillips 1
was 93
always 1
glad 30
to 805
see 70
her 181
nieces 1
and 51
the 193
two 14
eldest 1
from 2
their 2
recent 6
absence 3
were 5
particularly 1
welcome 4
and 51
she 199
was 93
eagerly 1
expressing 1
her 181
surprise 4
at 272
their 2
sudden 4
return 14
home 90
which 2
as 509
their 2
own 9
carriage 5
had 11
not 85
fetched 1
them 9
she 199
should 7
have 11
known 1
nothing 5
about 1
if 8
she 199
had 11
not 85
happened 1
to 805
see 70
mr 5
shop 33
boy 25
in 2719
the 193
street 15
who 79
had 11
told 1
her 181
that 11
they 5
were 5
not 85
to 805
send 10
any 17
more 11
to 805
because 1
the 193
miss 71
were 5
come 36
away 1
when 6
her 181
civility 2
was 93
claimed 1
towards 1
mr 5
collins 1
by 57
introduction 3
of 109
him 9
she 199
received 1
him 9
with 34
her 181
very 1
best 37
politeness 2
which 2
he 962
returned 1
with 34
as 509
much 2
more 11
for 484
his 43
intrusion 3
without 1
any 17
previous 2
acquaintance 5
with 34
her 181
which 2
he 962
could 2
not 85
help 23
flattering 2
himself 1
however 1
might 9
be 1200
justified 1
by 57
his 43
relationship 3
to 805
the 193
young 9
ladies 1
who 79
introduced 1
him 9
to 805
her 181
notice 8
mrs 1
phillips 1
was 93
quite 1
awed 1
by 57
such 2
an 970
excess 5
of 109
good 28
breeding 2
but 82
her 181
contemplation 2
of 109
one 19
stranger 3
was 93
soon 3
put 47
to 805
an 970
end 92
by 57
exclamations 1
and 51
inquiries 1
about 1
the 193
other 5
of 109
whom 3
however 1
she 199
could 2
only 1
tell 16
her 181
nieces 1
what 14
they 5
already 1
knew 1
that 11
mr 5
denny 2
had 11
brought 1
him 9
from 2
london 5
and 51
that 11
he 962
was 93
to 805
have 11
a 6799
lieutenant's 1
commission 10
in 2719
the 193
shire 3
she 199
had 11
been 1
watching 1
him 9
the 193
last 7
hour 10
she 199
said 1
as 509
he 962
walked 1
up 194
and 51
down 90
the 193
street 15
and 51
had 11
mr 5
appeared 1
kitty 2
and 51
lydia 4
would 5
certainly 1
have 11
continued 1
the 193
occupation 5
but 82
unluckily 1
no 896
one 19
passed 1
windows 4
now 10
except 10
a 6799
few 6
of 109
the 193
officers 1
who 79
in 2719
comparison 3
with 34
the 193
stranger 3
were 5
become 2
stupid 9
disagreeable 3
fellows 4
some 30
of 109
them 9
were 5
to 805
dine 9
with 34
the 193
the 193
next 2
day 27
and 51
their 2
aunt 6
promised 1
to 805
make 17
her 181
husband 10
call 57
on 86
mr 5
and 51
give 15
him 9
an 970
invitation 6
also 3
if 8
the 193
family 2
from 2
would 5
come 36
in 2719
the 193
evening 3
this 6
was 93
agreed 1
to 805
and 51
mrs 1
phillips 1
protested 1
that 11
they 5
would 5
have 11
a 6799
nice 11
comfortable 3
noisy 1
game 24
of 109
lottery 2
tickets 1
and 51
a 6799
little 6
bit 48
of 109
hot 56
supper 4
afterwards 1
the 193
prospect 13
of 109
such 2
delights 1
was 93
very 1
cheering 1
and 51
they 5
parted 1
in 2719
mutual 4
good 28
spirits 1
mr 5
collins 1
repeated 2
his 43
apologies 1
in 2719
quitting 1
the 193
room 22
and 51
was 93
assured 4
with 34
civility 2
that 11
they 5
were 5
perfectly 1
needless 4
as 509
they 5
walked 1
home 90
elizabeth 5
related 3
to 805
jane 8
what 14
she 199
had 11
seen 1
pass 66
between 1
the 193
two 14
gentlemen 1
but 82
though 12
jane 8
would 5
have 11
defended 1
either 1
or 333
both 8
had 11
they 5
appeared 1
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
the 193
wrong 24
she 199
could 2
no 896
more 11
explain 5
such 2
than 22
her 181
sister 9
mr 5
collins 1
on 86
his 43
return 14
highly 1
gratified 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
by 57
admiring 2
mrs 1
manners 1
and 51
politeness 2
he 962
protested 1
that 11
except 10
lady 18
catherine 2
and 51
her 181
daughter 4
he 962
had 11
never 3
seen 1
a 6799
more 11
elegant 2
woman 21
for 484
she 199
had 11
not 85
only 1
received 1
him 9
with 34
the 193
utmost 2
civility 2
but 82
even 36
pointedly 1
included 1
him 9
in 2719
her 181
invitation 6
for 484
the 193
next 2
evening 3
although 1
utterly 1
unknown 3
to 805
her 181
before 2
something 3
he 962
supposed 2
might 9
be 1200
attributed 1
to 805
his 43
connection 3
with 34
them 9
but 82
yet 4
he 962
had 11
never 3
met 180
with 34
so 797
much 2
attention 3
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
course 10
of 109
his 43
life 44
chapter 3
as 509
no 896
objection 5
was 93
made 13
to 805
the 193
young 9
people's 1
engagement 3
with 34
their 2
aunt 6
and 51
all 162
mr 5
scruples 1
of 109
leaving 3
mr 5
and 51
mrs 1
bennet 1
for 484
a 6799
single 15
evening 3
during 1
his 43
visit 14
were 5
most 3
steadily 1
resisted 1
the 193
coach 11
conveyed 1
him 9
and 51
his 43
five 5
cousins 1
at 272
a 6799
suitable 3
hour 10
to 805
and 51
the 193
girls 1
had 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
hearing 3
as 509
they 5
entered 1
the 193
drawing 3
room 22
that 11
mr 5
had 11
accepted 1
their 2
uncle's 1
invitation 6
and 51
was 93
then 5
in 2719
the 193
house 87
when 6
this 6
information 3
was 93
given 3
and 51
they 5
had 11
all 162
taken 1
their 2
seats 1
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
at 272
leisure 8
to 805
look 14
around 1
him 9
and 51
admire 6
and 51
he 962
was 93
so 797
much 2
struck 1
with 34
the 193
size 5
and 51
furniture 2
of 109
the 193
apartment 3
that 11
he 962
declared 1
he 962
might 9
almost 1
have 11
supposed 2
himself 1
in 2719
the 193
small 14
summer 13
breakfast 5
at 272
a 6799
comparison 3
that 11
did 23
not 85
at 272
first 8
convey 12
much 2
gratification 3
but 82
when 6
mrs 1
phillips 1
understood 1
from 2
him 9
what 14
was 93
and 51
who 79
was 93
its 2
proprietor 7
when 6
she 199
had 11
listened 1
to 805
the 193
description 3
of 109
only 1
one 19
of 109
lady 18
catherine's 1
drawing 3
rooms 1
and 51
found 18
that 11
the 193
chimney 3
piece 10
alone 1
had 11
cost 32
eight 18
hundred 10
pounds 1
she 199
felt 5
all 162
the 193
force 10
of 109
the 193
compliment 6
and 51
would 5
hardly 1
have 11
resented 1
a 6799
comparison 3
with 34
the 193
housekeeper's 1
room 22
in 2719
describing 1
to 805
her 181
all 162
the 193
grandeur 2
of 109
lady 18
catherine 2
and 51
her 181
mansion 3
with 34
occasional 2
digressions 1
in 2719
praise 7
of 109
his 43
own 9
humble 9
abode 3
and 51
the 193
improvements 1
it 67
was 93
receiving 1
he 962
was 93
happily 1
employed 1
until 1
the 193
gentlemen 1
joined 1
them 9
and 51
he 962
found 18
in 2719
mrs 1
phillips 1
a 6799
very 1
attentive 4
listener 3
whose 1
opinion 4
of 109
his 43
consequence 3
increased 1
with 34
what 14
she 199
heard 1
and 51
who 79
was 93
resolving 1
to 805
retail 8
it 67
all 162
among 1
her 181
as 509
soon 3
as 509
she 199
could 2
to 805
the 193
girls 1
who 79
could 2
not 85
listen 9
to 805
their 2
cousin 3
and 51
who 79
had 11
nothing 5
to 805
do 814
but 82
to 805
wish 13
for 484
an 970
instrument 16
and 51
examine 6
their 2
own 9
indifferent 2
imitations 1
of 109
china 5
on 86
the 193
mantelpiece 3
the 193
interval 3
of 109
waiting 2
appeared 1
very 1
long 49
it 67
was 93
over 596
at 272
last 7
however 1
the 193
gentlemen 1
did 23
approach 6
and 51
when 6
mr 5
walked 1
into 26
the 193
room 22
elizabeth 5
felt 5
that 11
she 199
had 11
neither 1
been 1
seeing 2
him 9
before 2
nor 102
thinking 2
of 109
him 9
since 7
with 34
the 193
smallest 1
degree 3
of 109
unreasonable 3
admiration 2
the 193
officers 1
of 109
the 193
shire 3
were 5
in 2719
general 22
a 6799
very 1
creditable 1
set 40
and 51
the 193
best 37
of 109
them 9
were 5
of 109
the 193
present 20
party 3
but 82
mr 5
was 93
as 509
far 91
beyond 1
them 9
all 162
in 2719
person 33
countenance 4
air 129
and 51
walk 25
as 509
they 5
were 5
superior 5
to 805
the 193
broad 41
faced 1
stuffy 1
uncle 18
phillips 1
breathing 2
port 90
wine 18
who 79
followed 1
them 9
into 26
the 193
room 22
mr 5
was 93
the 193
happy 1
man 342
towards 1
whom 3
almost 1
every 10
female 5
eye 57
was 93
turned 1
and 51
elizabeth 5
was 93
the 193
happy 1
woman 21
by 57
whom 3
he 962
finally 1
seated 1
himself 1
and 51
the 193
agreeable 3
manner 8
in 2719
which 2
he 962
immediately 1
fell 22
into 26
conversation 8
though 12
it 67
was 93
only 1
on 86
its 2
being 3
a 6799
wet 19
night 61
made 13
her 181
feel 11
that 11
the 193
commonest 1
dullest 1
most 3
threadbare 1
topic 7
might 9
be 1200
rendered 1
interesting 2
by 57
the 193
skill 11
of 109
the 193
speaker 5
with 34
such 2
rivals 1
for 484
the 193
notice 8
of 109
the 193
fair 25
as 509
mr 5
and 51
the 193
officers 1
mr 5
collins 1
seemed 1
to 805
sink 13
into 26
insignificance 2
to 805
the 193
young 9
ladies 1
he 962
certainly 1
was 93
nothing 5
but 82
he 962
had 11
still 13
at 272
intervals 1
a 6799
kind 31
listener 3
in 2719
mrs 1
phillips 1
and 51
was 93
by 57
her 181
watchfulness 2
most 3
abundantly 1
supplied 1
with 34
coffee 15
and 51
muffin 4
when 6
the 193
card 54
tables 7
were 5
placed 1
he 962
had 11
the 193
opportunity 2
of 109
obliging 2
her 181
in 2719
turn 46
by 57
sitting 3
down 90
to 805
whist 10
i 4330
know 12
little 6
of 109
the 193
game 24
at 272
present 20
said 1
he 962
but 82
i 4330
shall 12
be 1200
glad 30
to 805
improve 6
myself 1
for 484
in 2719
my 90
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
mrs 1
phillips 1
was 93
very 1
glad 30
for 484
his 43
compliance 2
but 82
could 2
not 85
wait 19
for 484
his 43
reason 13
mr 5
did 23
not 85
play 73
at 272
whist 10
and 51
with 34
ready 2
delight 8
was 93
he 962
received 1
at 272
the 193
other 5
table 27
between 1
elizabeth 5
and 51
lydia 4
at 272
first 8
there 21
seemed 1
danger 7
of 109
engrossing 1
him 9
entirely 1
for 484
she 199
was 93
a 6799
most 3
determined 2
talker 3
but 82
being 3
likewise 1
extremely 1
fond 17
of 109
lottery 2
tickets 1
she 199
soon 3
grew 1
too 50
much 2
interested 1
in 2719
the 193
game 24
too 50
eager 6
in 2719
making 4
bets 3
and 51
exclaiming 1
after 48
prizes 1
to 805
have 11
attention 3
for 484
anyone 2
in 2719
particular 13
allowing 1
for 484
the 193
common 23
demands 1
of 109
the 193
game 24
mr 5
was 93
therefore 1
at 272
leisure 8
to 805
talk 18
to 805
elizabeth 5
and 51
she 199
was 93
very 1
willing 4
to 805
hear 76
him 9
though 12
what 14
she 199
chiefly 1
wished 1
to 805
hear 76
she 199
could 2
not 85
hope 16
to 805
be 1200
told 1
the 193
history 2
of 109
his 43
acquaintance 5
with 34
mr 5
darcy 2
she 199
dared 6
not 85
even 36
mention 5
that 11
gentleman 3
her 181
curiosity 2
however 1
was 93
unexpectedly 1
relieved 1
mr 5
began 1
the 193
subject 11
himself 1
he 962
inquired 1
how 27
far 91
was 93
from 2
and 51
after 48
receiving 1
her 181
answer 8
asked 1
in 2719
a 6799
hesitating 2
manner 8
how 27
long 49
mr 5
darcy 2
had 11
been 1
staying 1
there 21
about 1
a 6799
month 6
said 1
elizabeth 5
and 51
then 5
unwilling 4
to 805
let 50
the 193
subject 11
drop 22
added 1
he 962
is 124
a 6799
man 342
of 109
very 1
large 11
property 2
in 2719
i 4330
understand 8
yes 16
replied 1
mr 5
his 43
estate 3
there 21
is 124
a 6799
noble 13
one 19
a 6799
clear 23
ten 151
thousand 7
per 551
you 29
could 2
not 85
have 11
met 180
with 34
a 6799
person 33
more 11
capable 1
of 109
giving 2
you 29
certain 5
information 3
on 86
that 11
head 140
than 22
myself 1
for 484
i 4330
have 11
been 1
connected 1
with 34
his 43
family 2
in 2719
a 6799
particular 13
manner 8
from 2
my 90
infancy 2
elizabeth 5
could 2
not 85
but 82
look 14
surprised 1
you 29
may 49
well 24
be 1200
surprised 1
miss 71
bennet 1
at 272
such 2
an 970
assertion 3
after 48
seeing 2
as 509
you 29
probably 1
might 9
the 193
very 1
cold 9
manner 8
of 109
our 3
meeting 6
yesterday 3
are 12
you 29
much 2
acquainted 1
with 34
mr 5
darcy 2
as 509
much 2
as 509
i 4330
ever 33
wish 13
to 805
be 1200
cried 1
elizabeth 5
very 1
warmly 1
i 4330
have 11
spent 1
four 26
days 1
in 2719
the 193
same 5
house 87
with 34
him 9
and 51
i 4330
think 8
him 9
very 1
disagreeable 3
i 4330
have 11
no 896
right 31
to 805
give 15
my 90
opinion 4
said 1
as 509
to 805
his 43
being 3
agreeable 3
or 333
otherwise 1
i 4330
am 392
not 85
qualified 1
to 805
form 68
one 19
i 4330
have 11
known 1
him 9
too 50
long 49
and 51
too 50
well 24
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
fair 25
judge 6
it 67
is 124
impossible 2
for 484
me 1041
to 805
be 1200
impartial 4
but 82
i 4330
believe 6
your 4
opinion 4
of 109
him 9
would 5
in 2719
general 22
astonish 7
and 51
perhaps 1
you 29
would 5
not 85
express 25
it 67
quite 1
so 797
strongly 1
anywhere 1
else 2
here 31
you 29
are 12
in 2719
your 4
own 9
family 2
upon 1
my 90
word 26
i 4330
say 7
no 896
more 11
here 31
than 22
i 4330
might 9
say 7
in 2719
any 17
house 87
in 2719
the 193
except 10
he 962
is 124
not 85
at 272
all 162
liked 1
in 2719
everybody 2
is 124
disgusted 2
with 34
his 43
pride 6
you 29
will 39
not 85
find 10
him 9
more 11
spoken 1
of 109
by 57
anyone 2
i 4330
cannot 1
pretend 7
to 805
be 1200
sorry 1
said 1
after 48
a 6799
short 62
interruption 3
that 11
he 962
or 333
that 11
any 17
man 342
should 7
not 85
be 1200
estimated 1
beyond 1
their 2
deserts 1
but 82
with 34
him 9
i 4330
believe 6
it 67
does 5
not 85
often 4
happen 9
the 193
world 12
is 124
blinded 1
by 57
his 43
fortune 8
and 51
consequence 3
or 333
frightened 1
by 57
his 43
high 54
and 51

take 18
him 9
even 36
on 86
my 90
slight 10
acquaintance 5

an 970
ill 84

only 1
shook 1
his 43

i 4330
wonder 17
said 1
he 962
at 272
the 193
next 2
opportunity 2
of 109
speaking 2
whether 1
he 962
is 124
likely 1
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
this 6
country 12
much 2
longer 1
i 4330
do 814
not 85
at 272
all 162
know 12
but 82
i 4330
heard 1
nothing 5
of 109
his 43
going 3
away 1
when 6
i 4330
was 93
at 272
i 4330
hope 16
your 4
plans 1
in 2719
of 109
the 193
shire 3
will 39
not 85
be 1200
affected 2
by 57
his 43
being 3
in 2719
the 193
oh 17
no 896
it 67
is 124
not 85
for 484
me 1041
to 805
be 1200
driven 1
away 1
by 57
mr 5
darcy 2
if 8
he 962
wishes 1
to 805
avoid 8
seeing 2
me 1041
he 962
must 28
go 500
we 444
are 12
not 85
on 86
friendly 2
terms 1
and 51
it 67
always 1
gives 1
me 1041
pain 42
to 805
meet 9
him 9
but 82
i 4330
have 11
no 896
reason 13
for 484
avoiding 1
him 9
but 82
what 14
i 4330
might 9
proclaim 4
before 2
all 162
the 193
world 12
a 6799
sense 8
of 109
very 1
great 12
ill 84
usage 3
and 51
most 3
painful 6
regrets 1
at 272
his 43
being 3
what 14
he 962
is 124
his 43
father 12
miss 71
bennet 1
the 193
late 23
mr 5
darcy 2
was 93
one 19
of 109
the 193
best 37
men 140
that 11
ever 33
breathed 1
and 51
the 193
truest 1
friend 14
i 4330
ever 33
had 11
and 51
i 4330
can 287
never 3
be 1200
in 2719
company 2
with 34
this 6
mr 5
darcy 2
without 1
being 3
grieved 1
to 805
the 193
soul 10
by 57
a 6799
thousand 7
tender 27
recollections 1
his 43
to 805
myself 1
has 41
been 1
scandalous 2
but 82
i 4330
verily 1
believe 6
i 4330
could 2
forgive 8
him 9
anything 3
and 51
everything 2
rather 2
than 22
his 43
disappointing 2
the 193
hopes 1
and 51
disgracing 1
the 193
memory 2
of 109
his 43
father 12
elizabeth 5
found 18
the 193
interest 6
of 109
the 193
subject 11
increase 4
and 51
listened 1
with 34
all 162
her 181
heart 57
but 82
the 193
delicacy 2
of 109
it 67
prevented 1
further 8
inquiry 2
mr 5
began 1
to 805
speak 12
on 86
more 11
general 22
topics 1
the 193
the 193
society 2
appearing 1
highly 1
pleased 1
with 34
all 162
that 11
he 962
had 11
yet 4
seen 1
and 51
speaking 2
of 109
the 193
latter 3
with 34
gentle 18
but 82
very 1
intelligible 1
gallantry 2
it 67
was 93
the 193
prospect 13
of 109
constant 7
society 2
and 51
good 28
society 2
he 962
added 1
which 2
was 93
my 90
chief 14
inducement 3
to 805
enter 23
the 193
shire 3
i 4330
knew 1
it 67
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
most 3
respectable 1
agreeable 3
corps 8
and 51
my 90
friend 14
denny 2
tempted 1
me 1041
further 8
by 57
his 43
account 14
of 109
their 2
present 20
quarters 4
and 51
the 193
very 1
great 12
attentions 1
and 51
excellent 2
acquaintances 3
had 11
procured 1
them 9
society 2
i 4330
own 9
is 124
necessary 2
to 805
me 1041
i 4330
have 11
been 1
a 6799
disappointed 1
man 342
and 51
my 90
spirits 1
will 39
not 85
bear 30
solitude 2
i 4330
must 28
have 11
employment 3
and 51
society 2
a 6799
military 2
life 44
is 124
not 85
what 14
i 4330
was 93
intended 3
for 484
but 82
circumstances 1
have 11
now 10
made 13
it 67
eligible 1
the 193
church 21
ought 2
to 805
have 11
been 1
my 90
profession 14
i 4330
was 93
brought 1
up 194
for 484
the 193
church 21
and 51
i 4330
should 7
at 272
this 6
time 45
have 11
been 1
in 2719
possession 3
of 109
a 6799
most 3
valuable 3
living 5
had 11
it 67
pleased 1
the 193
gentleman 3
we 444
were 5
speaking 2
of 109
just 24
now 10
indeed 1
yes 16
the 193
late 23
mr 5
darcy 2
bequeathed 1
me 1041
the 193
next 2
presentation 3
of 109
the 193
best 37
living 5
in 2719
his 43
gift 5
he 962
was 93
my 90
godfather 3
and 51
excessively 1
attached 1
to 805
me 1041
i 4330
cannot 1
do 814
justice 3
to 805
his 43
kindness 3
he 962
meant 3
to 805
provide 13
for 484
me 1041
amply 1
and 51
thought 11
he 962
had 11
done 3
it 67
but 82
when 6
the 193
living 5
fell 22
it 67
was 93
given 3
elsewhere 1
good 28
heavens 2
cried 1
elizabeth 5
but 82
how 27
could 2
that 11
be 1200
how 27
could 2
his 43
will 39
be 1200
disregarded 1
why 4
did 23
you 29
not 85
seek 6
legal 21
redress 5
there 21
was 93
just 24
such 2
an 970
informality 2
in 2719
the 193
terms 1
of 109
the 193
bequest 3
as 509
to 805
give 15
me 1041
no 896
hope 16
from 2
law 45
a 6799
man 342
of 109
could 2
not 85
have 11
doubted 1
the 193
intention 5
but 82
mr 5
darcy 2
chose 2
to 805
doubt 15
it 67
or 333
to 805
treat 15
it 67
as 509
a 6799
merely 1
conditional 4
recommendation 3
and 51
to 805
assert 11
that 11
i 4330
had 11
forfeited 1
all 162
claim 12
to 805
it 67
by 57
extravagance 3
imprudence 2
in 2719
short 62
anything 3
or 333
nothing 5
certain 5
it 67
is 124
that 11
the 193
living 5
became 1
vacant 2
two 14
years 1
ago 15
exactly 1
as 509
i 4330
was 93
of 109
an 970
age 24
to 805
hold 22
it 67
and 51
that 11
it 67
was 93
given 3
to 805
another 1
man 342
and 51
no 896
less 19
certain 5
is 124
it 67
that 11
i 4330
cannot 1
accuse 6
myself 1
of 109
having 1
really 1
done 3
anything 3
to 805
deserve 4
to 805
lose 5
it 67
i 4330
have 11
a 6799
warm 23
unguarded 1
temper 22
and 51
i 4330
may 49
have 11
spoken 1
my 90
opinion 4
of 109
him 9
and 51
to 805
him 9
too 50
freely 1
i 4330
can 287
recall 5
nothing 5
worse 6
but 82
the 193
fact 35
is 124
that 11
we 444
are 12
very 1
different 11
sort 14
of 109
men 140
and 51
that 11
he 962
hates 1
me 1041
this 6
is 124
quite 1
shocking 2
he 962
deserves 1
to 805
be 1200
publicly 1
disgraced 1
some 30
time 45
or 333
other 5
he 962
will 39
be 1200
but 82
it 67
shall 12
not 85
be 1200
by 57
me 1041
till 14
i 4330
can 287
forget 8
his 43
father 12
i 4330
can 287
never 3
defy 2
or 333
expose 4
him 9
elizabeth 5
him 9
for 484
such 2
feelings 1
and 51
thought 11
him 9
handsomer 1
than 22
ever 33
as 509
he 962
expressed 1
them 9
but 82
what 14
said 1
she 199
after 48
a 6799
pause 4
can 287
have 11
been 1
his 43
motive 4
what 14
can 287
have 11
induced 1
him 9
to 805
behave 3
so 797
cruelly 1
a 6799
thorough 13
determined 2
dislike 4
of 109
me 1041
a 6799
dislike 4
which 2
i 4330
cannot 1
but 82
attribute 4
in 2719
some 30
measure 8
to 805
jealousy 2
had 11
the 193
late 23
mr 5
darcy 2
liked 1
me 1041
less 19
his 43
son 70
might 9
have 11
borne 3
with 34
me 1041
better 7
but 82
his 43
father's 1
uncommon 6
attachment 3
to 805
me 1041
irritated 1
him 9
i 4330
believe 6
very 1
early 1
in 2719
life 44
he 962
had 11
not 85
a 6799
temper 22
to 805
bear 30
the 193
sort 14
of 109
competition 3
in 2719
which 2
we 444
stood 1
the 193
sort 14
of 109
preference 3
which 2
was 93
often 4
given 3
me 1041
i 4330
had 11
not 85
thought 11
mr 5
darcy 2
so 797
bad 33
as 509
this 6
though 12
i 4330
have 11
never 3
liked 1
him 9
i 4330
had 11
not 85
thought 11
so 797
very 1
ill 84
of 109
him 9
i 4330
had 11
supposed 2
him 9
to 805
be 1200
despising 1
his 43
fellow 9
creatures 1
in 2719
general 22
but 82
did 23
not 85
suspect 5
him 9
of 109
descending 1
to 805
such 2
malicious 4
revenge 6
such 2
injustice 3
such 2
inhumanity 2
as 509
this 6
after 48
a 6799
few 6
reflection 3
however 1
she 199
continued 1
i 4330
do 814
remember 4
his 43
boasting 1
one 19
day 27
at 272
of 109
the 193
implacability 2
of 109
his 43
resentments 1
of 109
his 43
having 1
an 970
unforgiving 1
temper 22
his 43
disposition 3
must 28
be 1200
dreadful 4
i 4330
will 39
not 85
trust 26
myself 1
on 86
the 193
subject 11
replied 1
i 4330
can 287
hardly 1
be 1200
just 24
to 805
him 9
elizabeth 5
was 93
again 2
deep 12
in 2719
thought 11
and 51
after 48
a 6799
time 45
exclaimed 1
to 805
treat 15
in 2719
such 2
a 6799
manner 8
the 193
godson 3
the 193
friend 14
the 193
of 109
his 43
father 12
she 199
could 2
have 11
added 1
a 6799
young 9
man 342
too 50
like 22
you 29
whose 1
very 1
countenance 4
may 49
vouch 11
for 484
your 4
being 3
amiable 1
but 82
she 199
contented 4
herself 1
with 34
and 51
one 19
too 50
who 79
had 11
probably 1
been 1
his 43
companion 10
from 2
childhood 3
connected 1
together 3
as 509
i 4330
think 8
you 29
said 1
in 2719
the 193
closest 1
manner 8
we 444
were 5
born 4
in 2719
the 193
same 5
parish 6
within 3
the 193
same 5
park 18
the 193
greatest 1
part 102
of 109
our 3
youth 7
was 93
passed 1
together 3
inmates 1
of 109
the 193
same 5
house 87
sharing 1
the 193
same 5
amusements 1
objects 1
of 109
the 193
same 5
parental 1
care 47
my 90
father 12
began 1
life 44
in 2719
the 193
profession 14
which 2
your 4
uncle 18
mr 5
phillips 1
appears 1
to 805
do 814
so 797
much 2
credit 12
to 805
but 82
he 962
gave 4
up 194
everything 2
to 805
be 1200
of 109
use 18
to 805
the 193
late 23
mr 5
darcy 2
and 51
devoted 2
all 162
his 43
time 45
to 805
the 193
care 47
of 109
the 193
property 2
he 962
was 93
most 3
highly 1
esteemed 1
by 57
mr 5
darcy 2
a 6799
most 3
intimate 5
confidential 4
friend 14
mr 5
darcy 2
often 4
acknowledged 1
himself 1
to 805
be 1200
under 288
the 193
greatest 1
obligations 1
to 805
my 90
father's 1
active 6
superintendence 2
and 51
when 6
immediately 1
before 2
my 90
father's 1
death 19
mr 5
darcy 2
gave 4
him 9
a 6799
voluntary 2
promise 4
of 109
providing 1
for 484
me 1041
i 4330
am 392
convinced 1
that 11
he 962
felt 5
it 67
to 805
be 1200
as 509
much 2
a 6799
debt 6
of 109
gratitude 2
to 805
him 9
as 509
of 109
his 43
affection 5
to 805
myself 1
how 27
strange 8
cried 1
elizabeth 5
how 27
abominable 1
i 4330
wonder 17
that 11
the 193
very 1
pride 6
of 109
this 6
mr 5
darcy 2
has 41
not 85
made 13
him 9
just 24
to 805
you 29
if 8
from 2
no 896
better 7
motive 4
that 11
he 962
should 7
not 85
have 11
been 1
too 50
proud 5
to 805
be 1200
dishonest 4
for 484
dishonesty 2
i 4330
must 28
call 57
it 67
it 67
is 124
wonderful 4
replied 1
for 484
almost 1
all 162
his 43
actions 1
may 49
be 1200
traced 1
to 805
pride 6
and 51
pride 6
had 11
often 4
been 1
his 43
best 37
friend 14
it 67
has 41
connected 1
him 9
nearer 1
with 34
virtue 3
than 22
with 34
any 17
other 5
feeling 4
but 82
we 444
are 12
none 32
of 109
us 70
consistent 2
and 51
in 2719
his 43
to 805
me 1041
there 21
were 5
stronger 1
impulses 1
even 36
than 22
pride 6
can 287
such 2
abominable 1
pride 6
as 509
his 43
have 11
ever 33
done 3
him 9
good 28
yes 16
it 67
has 41
often 4
led 11
him 9
to 805
be 1200
liberal 17
and 51
generous 4
to 805
give 15
his 43
money 17
freely 1
to 805
display 6
hospitality 2
to 805
assist 10
his 43
tenants 1
and 51
relieve 6
the 193
poor 11
family 2
pride 6
and 51
filial 1
pride 6
for 484
he 962
is 124
very 1
proud 5
of 109
what 14
his 43
father 12
was 93
have 11
done 3
this 6
not 85
to 805
appear 7
to 805
disgrace 8
his 43
family 2
to 805
degenerate 4
from 2
the 193
popular 10
qualities 1
or 333
lose 5
the 193
influence 4
of 109
the 193
house 87
is 124
a 6799
powerful 2
motive 4
he 962
has 41
also 3
brotherly 1
pride 6
which 2
with 34
some 30
brotherly 1
affection 5
makes 4
him 9
a 6799
very 1
kind 31
and 51
careful 6
guardian 5
of 109
his 43
sister 9
and 51
you 29
will 39
hear 76
him 9
generally 1
cried 1
up 194
as 509
the 193
most 3
attentive 4
and 51
best 37
of 109
brothers 1
what 14
sort 14
of 109
girl 14
is 124

darcy 2
he 962
shook 1
his 43
head 140
i 4330
wish 13
i 4330
could 2
call 57
her 181
amiable 1
it 67
gives 1
me 1041
pain 42
to 805
speak 12
ill 84
of 109
a 6799
darcy 2
but 82
she 199
is 124
too 50
much 2
like 22
her 181
brother 9
very 1
very 1
proud 5
as 509
a 6799
child 28
she 199
was 93
affectionate 2
and 51
pleasing 3
and 51
extremely 1
fond 17
of 109
me 1041
and 51
i 4330
have 11
devoted 2
hours 1
and 51
hours 1
to 805
her 181
amusement 3
but 82
she 199
is 124
nothing 5
to 805
me 1041
now 10
she 199
is 124
a 6799
handsome 6
girl 14
about 1
fifteen 6
or 333
sixteen 6
and 51
i 4330
understand 8
highly 1
accomplished 1
since 7
her 181
father's 1
death 19
her 181
home 90
has 41
been 1
london 5
where 21
a 6799
lady 18
lives 4
with 34
her 181
and 51
superintends 1
her 181
education 9
after 48
many 2
pauses 1
and 51
many 2
trials 1
of 109
other 5
subjects 1
elizabeth 5
could 2
not 85
help 23
reverting 1
once 2
more 11
to 805
the 193
first 8
and 51
saying 3
i 4330
am 392
astonished 1
at 272
his 43
intimacy 2
with 34
mr 5
how 27
can 287
mr 5
who 79
seems 1
good 28
itself 1
and 51
is 124
i 4330
really 1
believe 6
truly 1
amiable 1
be 1200
in 2719
friendship 3
with 34
such 2
a 6799
man 342
how 27
can 287
they 5
suit 21
each 1
other 5
do 814
you 29
know 12
mr 5
not 85
at 272
all 162
he 962
is 124
a 6799
sweet 33
tempered 1
amiable 1
charming 2
man 342
he 962
cannot 1
know 12
what 14
mr 5
darcy 2
is 124
probably 1
not 85
but 82
mr 5
darcy 2
can 287
please 3
where 21
he 962
chooses 1
he 962
does 5
not 85
want 13
abilities 1
he 962
can 287
be 1200
a 6799
companion 10
if 8
he 962
thinks 1
it 67
worth 15
his 43
while 4
among 1
those 1
who 79
are 12
at 272
all 162
his 43
equals 1
in 2719
consequence 3
he 962
is 124
a 6799
very 1
different 11
man 342
from 2
what 14
he 962
is 124
to 805
the 193
less 19
prosperous 2
his 43
pride 6
never 3
deserts 1
him 9
but 82
with 34
the 193
rich 19
he 962
is 124
liberal 17
minded 2
just 24
sincere 4
rational 22
and 51
perhaps 1
agreeable 3
allowing 1
something 3
for 484
fortune 8
and 51
figure 7
the 193
whist 10
party 3
soon 3
afterwards 1
breaking 1
up 194
the 193
players 1
gathered 1
round 29
the 193
other 5
table 27
and 51
mr 5
collins 1
took 1
his 43
station 13
between 1
his 43
cousin 3
elizabeth 5
and 51
mrs 1
phillips 1
the 193
usual 3
inquiries 1
as 509
to 805
his 43
success 13
were 5
made 13
by 57
the 193
latter 3
it 67
had 11
not 85
been 1
very 1
great 12
he 962
had 11
lost 1
every 10
point 22
but 82
when 6
mrs 1
phillips 1
began 1
to 805
express 25
her 181
concern 6
thereupon 1
he 962
assured 4
her 181
with 34
much 2
earnest 8
gravity 2
that 11
it 67
was 93
not 85
of 109
the 193
least 3
importance 2
that 11
he 962
considered 1
the 193
money 17
as 509
a 6799
mere 10
trifle 7
and 51
begged 1
that 11
she 199
would 5
not 85
make 17
herself 1
uneasy 1
i 4330
know 12
very 1
well 24
madam 5
said 1
he 962
that 11
when 6
persons 1
sit 29
down 90
to 805
a 6799
card 54
table 27
they 5
must 28
take 18
their 2
chances 1
of 109
these 4
things 1
and 51
happily 1
i 4330
am 392
not 85
in 2719
such 2
circumstances 1
as 509
to 805
make 17
five 5
shillings 1
any 17
object 26
there 21
are 12
undoubtedly 1
many 2
who 79
could 2
not 85
say 7
the 193
same 5
but 82
thanks 4
to 805
lady 18
catherine 2
de 2452
i 4330
am 392
removed 1
far 91
beyond 1
the 193
necessity 2
of 109
regarding 1
little 6
matters 1
mr 5
attention 3
was 93
caught 1
and 51
after 48
observing 1
mr 5
collins 1
for 484
a 6799
few 6
moments 1
he 962
asked 1
elizabeth 5
in 2719
a 6799
low 46
voice 8
whether 1
her 181
relation 7
was 93
very 1
intimately 1
acquainted 1
with 34
the 193
family 2
of 109
de 2452
lady 18
catherine 2
de 2452
she 199
replied 1
has 41
very 1
lately 1
given 3
him 9
a 6799
living 5
i 4330
hardly 1
know 12
how 27
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
first 8
introduced 1
to 805
her 181
notice 8
but 82
he 962
certainly 1
has 41
not 85
known 1
her 181
long 49
you 29
know 12
of 109
course 10
that 11
lady 18
catherine 2
de 2452
and 51
lady 18
anne 18
darcy 2
were 5
sisters 1
consequently 1
that 11
she 199
is 124
aunt 6
to 805
the 193
present 20
mr 5
darcy 2
no 896
indeed 1
i 4330
did 23
not 85
i 4330
knew 1
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
of 109
lady 18
catherine's 1
connections 1
i 4330
never 3
heard 1
of 109
her 181
existence 3
till 14
the 193
day 27
before 2
yesterday 3
her 181
daughter 4
miss 71
de 2452
will 39
have 11
a 6799
very 1
large 11
fortune 8
and 51
it 67
is 124
believed 1
that 11
she 199
and 51
her 181
cousin 3
will 39
unite 4
the 193
two 14
estates 1
this 6
information 3
made 13
elizabeth 5
smile 7
as 509
she 199
thought 11
of 109
poor 11
miss 71
vain 8
indeed 1
must 28
be 1200
all 162
her 181
attentions 1
vain 8
and 51
useless 4
her 181
affection 5
for 484
his 43
sister 9
and 51
her 181
praise 7
of 109
himself 1
if 8
he 962
were 5
already 1
self 11
destined 1
for 484
another 1
mr 5
collins 1
said 1
she 199
speaks 1
highly 1
both 8
of 109
lady 18
catherine 2
and 51
her 181
daughter 4
but 82
from 2
some 30
particulars 1
that 11
he 962
has 41
related 3
of 109
her 181
ladyship 3
i 4330
suspect 5
his 43
gratitude 2
misleads 1
him 9
and 51
that 11
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
her 181
being 3
his 43
patroness 3
she 199
is 124
an 970
arrogant 2
conceited 4
woman 21
i 4330
believe 6
her 181
to 805
be 1200
both 8
in 2719
a 6799
great 12
degree 3
replied 1
i 4330
have 11
not 85
seen 1
her 181
for 484
many 2
years 1
but 82
i 4330
very 1
well 24
remember 4
that 11
i 4330
never 3
liked 1
her 181
and 51
that 11
her 181
manners 1
were 5
dictatorial 2
and 51
insolent 2
she 199
has 41
the 193
reputation 3
of 109
being 3
remarkably 1
sensible 3
and 51
clever 6
but 82
i 4330
rather 2
believe 6
she 199
derives 1
part 102
of 109
her 181
abilities 1
from 2
her 181
rank 19
and 51
fortune 8
part 102
from 2
her 181
authoritative 4
manner 8
and 51
the 193
rest 110
from 2
the 193
pride 6
for 484
her 181
nephew 3
who 79
chooses 1
that 11
everyone 2
connected 1
with 34
him 9
should 7
have 11
an 970
understanding 4
of 109
the 193
first 8
class 44
elizabeth 5
allowed 1
that 11
he 962
had 11
given 3
a 6799
very 1
rational 22
account 14
of 109
it 67
and 51
they 5
continued 1
talking 1
together 3
with 34
mutual 4
satisfaction 3
till 14
supper 4
put 47
an 970
end 92
to 805
cards 7
and 51
gave 4
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
ladies 1
their 2
share 22
of 109
mr 5
attentions 1
there 21
could 2
be 1200
no 896
conversation 8
in 2719
the 193
noise 11
of 109
mrs 1
supper 4
party 3
but 82
his 43
manners 1
recommended 1
him 9
to 805
everybody 2
whatever 1
he 962
said 1
was 93
said 1
well 24
and 51
whatever 1
he 962
did 23
done 3
gracefully 1
elizabeth 5
went 1
away 1
with 34
her 181
head 140
full 16
of 109
him 9
she 199
could 2
think 8
of 109
nothing 5
but 82
of 109
mr 5
and 51
of 109
what 14
he 962
had 11
told 1
her 181
all 162
the 193
way 27
home 90
but 82
there 21
was 93
not 85
time 45
for 484
her 181
even 36
to 805
mention 5
his 43
name 17
as 509
they 5
went 1
for 484
neither 1
lydia 4
nor 102
mr 5
collins 1
were 5
once 2
silent 6
lydia 4

incessantly 1
of 109
lottery 2

had 11
lost 1
and 51
the 193

had 11
won 33

in 2719
describing 1
the 193
civility 2
of 109
mr 5
and 51
mrs 1
phillips 1
protesting 1
that 11
he 962
did 23
not 85
in 2719
the 193
least 3
regard 7
his 43
losses 1
at 272
whist 10
enumerating 1
all 162
the 193
dishes 1
at 272
supper 4
and 51
repeatedly 1
fearing 1
that 11
he 962
crowded 1
his 43
cousins 1
had 11
more 11
to 805
say 7
than 22

could 2

elizabeth 5
related 3
to 805
jane 8
the 193
next 2
day 27
what 14
had 11
passed 1
between 1
mr 5
and 51
herself 1
jane 8
listened 1
with 34
astonishment 2
and 51
concern 6
she 199
knew 1
not 85
how 27
to 805
believe 6
that 11
mr 5
darcy 2
could 2
be 1200
so 797
unworthy 1
of 109
mr 5
regard 7
and 51
yet 4
it 67
was 93
not 85
in 2719
her 181
nature 3
to 805
question 16
the 193
veracity 2
of 109
a 6799
young 9
man 342
of 109
such 2
amiable 1
appearance 3
as 509
the 193
possibility 2
of 109
his 43
having 1
endured 1
such 2
unkindness 2
was 93
enough 2
to 805
interest 6
all 162
her 181
tender 27
feelings 1
and 51
nothing 5
remained 1
therefore 1
to 805
be 1200
done 3
but 82
to 805
think 8
well 24
of 109
them 9
both 8
to 805
defend 10
the 193
conduct 21
of 109
each 1
and 51
throw 14
into 26
the 193
account 14
of 109
accident 7
or 333
mistake 5
whatever 1
could 2
not 85
be 1200
otherwise 1
explained 1
they 5
have 11
both 8
said 1
she 199
been 1
deceived 1
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
in 2719
some 30
way 27
or 333
other 5
of 109
which 2
we 444
can 287
form 68
no 896
idea 21
interested 1
people 4
have 11
perhaps 1
misrepresented 1
each 1
to 805
the 193
other 5
it 67
is 124
in 2719
short 62
impossible 2
for 484
us 70
to 805
conjecture 4
the 193
causes 1
or 333
circumstances 1
which 2
may 49
have 11
alienated 1
them 9
without 1
actual 11
blame 12
on 86
either 1
side 74
very 1
true 9
indeed 1
and 51
now 10
my 90
dear 15
jane 8
what 14
have 11
you 29
got 14
to 805
say 7
on 86
behalf 2
of 109
the 193
interested 1
people 4
who 79
have 11
probably 1
been 1
concerned 2
in 2719
the 193
business 13
do 814
clear 23
them 9
too 50
or 333
we 444
shall 12
be 1200
obliged 1
to 805
think 8
ill 84
of 109
somebody 2
laugh 14
as 509
much 2
as 509
you 29
choose 5
but 82
you 29
will 39
not 85
laugh 14
me 1041
out 365
of 109
my 90
opinion 4
my 90
dearest 2
lizzy 2
do 814
but 82
consider 13
in 2719
what 14
a 6799
disgraceful 4
light 42
it 67
places 1
mr 5
darcy 2
to 805
be 1200
treating 1
his 43
father's 1
in 2719
such 2
a 6799
manner 8
one 19
whom 3
his 43
father 12
had 11
promised 1
to 805
provide 13
for 484
it 67
is 124
impossible 2
no 896
man 342
of 109
common 23
humanity 2
no 896
man 342
who 79
had 11
any 17
value 8
for 484
his 43
character 16
could 2
be 1200
capable 1
of 109
it 67
can 287
his 43
most 3
intimate 5
friends 4
be 1200
so 797
excessively 1
deceived 1
in 2719
him 9
oh 17
no 896
i 4330
can 287
much 2
more 11
easily 1
believe 6
mr 5
being 3
imposed 1
on 86
than 22
that 11
mr 5
should 7
invent 19
such 2
a 6799
history 2
of 109
himself 1
as 509
he 962
gave 4
me 1041
last 7
night 61
names 4
facts 1
everything 2
mentioned 1
without 1
ceremony 2
if 8
it 67
be 1200
not 85
so 797
let 50
mr 5
darcy 2
contradict 8
it 67
besides 1
there 21
was 93
truth 7
in 2719
his 43
looks 1
it 67
is 124
difficult 5
indeed 1
it 67
is 124
distressing 2
one 19
does 5
not 85
know 12
what 14
to 805
think 8
i 4330
beg 59
your 4
pardon 10
one 19
knows 1
exactly 1
what 14
to 805
think 8
but 82
jane 8
could 2
think 8
with 34
certainty 2
on 86
only 1
one 19
point 22
that 11
mr 5
if 8
he 962
had 11
been 1
imposed 1
on 86
would 5
have 11
much 2
to 805
suffer 11
when 6
the 193
affair 3
became 1
public 18
the 193
two 14
young 9
ladies 1
were 5
summoned 1
from 2
the 193
shrubbery 2
where 21
this 6
conversation 8
passed 1
by 57
the 193
arrival 3
of 109
the 193
very 1
persons 1
of 109
whom 3
they 5
had 11
been 1
speaking 2
mr 5
and 51
his 43
sisters 1
came 36
to 805
give 15
their 2
personal 13
invitation 6
for 484
the 193
long 49
expected 1
ball 77
at 272
which 2
was 93
fixed 2
for 484
the 193
following 3
tuesday 3
the 193
two 14
ladies 1
were 5
delighted 2
to 805
see 70
their 2
dear 15
friend 14
again 2
called 1
it 67
an 970
age 24
since 7
they 5
had 11
met 180
and 51
repeatedly 1
asked 1
what 14
she 199
had 11
been 1
doing 3
with 34
herself 1
since 7
their 2
separation 3
to 805
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
family 2
they 5
paid 1
little 6
attention 3
avoiding 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
as 509
much 2
as 509
possible 3
saying 3
not 85
much 2
to 805
elizabeth 5
and 51
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
to 805
the 193
others 1
they 5
were 5
soon 3
gone 4
again 2
rising 3
from 2
their 2
seats 1
with 34
an 970
activity 2
which 2
took 1
their 2
brother 9
by 57
surprise 4
and 51
hurrying 1
off 100
as 509
if 8
eager 6
to 805
escape 10
from 2
mrs 1
civilities 1
the 193
prospect 13
of 109
the 193
ball 77
was 93
extremely 1
agreeable 3
to 805
every 10
female 5
of 109
the 193
family 2
mrs 1
bennet 1
chose 2
to 805
consider 13
it 67
as 509
given 3
in 2719
compliment 6
to 805
her 181
eldest 1
daughter 4
and 51
was 93
particularly 1
flattered 1
by 57
receiving 1
the 193
invitation 6
from 2
mr 5
himself 1
instead 1
of 109
a 6799
ceremonious 4
card 54
jane 8
pictured 1
to 805
herself 1
a 6799
happy 1
evening 3
in 2719
the 193
society 2
of 109
her 181
two 14
friends 4
and 51
the 193
attentions 1
of 109
their 2
brother 9
and 51
elizabeth 5
thought 11
with 34
pleasure 5
of 109
dancing 2
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
with 34
mr 5
and 51
of 109
seeing 2
a 6799
confirmation 3
of 109
everything 2
in 2719
mr 5
darcy's 1
look 14
and 51
the 193
happiness 2
anticipated 1
by 57
catherine 2
and 51
lydia 4
depended 1
less 19
on 86
any 17
single 15
event 18
or 333
any 17
particular 13
person 33
for 484
though 12
they 5
each 1
like 22
elizabeth 5
meant 3
to 805
dance 7
half 23
the 193
evening 3
with 34
mr 5
he 962
was 93
by 57
no 896
means 1
the 193
only 1
partner 8
who 79
could 2
satisfy 3
them 9
and 51
a 6799
ball 77
was 93
at 272
any 17
rate 9
a 6799
ball 77
and 51
even 36
mary 13
could 2
assure 6
her 181
family 2
that 11
she 199
had 11
no 896
disinclination 2
for 484
it 67
while 4
i 4330
can 287
have 11
my 90
mornings 1
to 805
myself 1
said 1
she 199
it 67
is 124
enough 2
i 4330
think 8
it 67
is 124
no 896
sacrifice 4
to 805
join 16
occasionally 1
in 2719
evening 3
engagements 1
society 2
has 41
claims 1
on 86
us 70
all 162
and 51
i 4330
profess 27
myself 1
one 19
of 109
those 1
who 79
consider 13
intervals 1
of 109
recreation 4
and 51
amusement 3
as 509
desirable 3
for 484
everybody 2
elizabeth's 1
spirits 1
were 5
so 797
high 54
on 86
this 6
occasion 7
that 11
though 12
she 199
did 23
not 85
often 4
speak 12
unnecessarily 1
to 805
mr 5
collins 1
she 199
could 2
not 85
help 23
asking 1
him 9
whether 1
he 962
intended 3
to 805
accept 16
mr 5
invitation 6
and 51
if 8
he 962
did 23
whether 1
he 962
would 5
think 8
it 67
proper 9
to 805
join 16
in 2719
the 193
evening's 1
amusement 3
and 51
she 199
was 93
rather 2
surprised 1
to 805
find 10
that 11
he 962
entertained 1
no 896
scruple 4
whatever 1
on 86
that 11
head 140
and 51
was 93
very 1
far 91
from 2
dreading 1
a 6799
rebuke 4
either 1
from 2
the 193
archbishop 6
or 333
lady 18
catherine 2
de 2452
by 57
venturing 1
to 805
dance 7
i 4330

of 109
the 193
opinion 4

he 962
that 11
a 6799
ball 77
of 109
this 6
kind 31
given 3
by 57
a 6799
young 9
man 342
of 109
character 16
to 805
respectable 1
people 4
can 287
have 11
any 17
evil 15
tendency 2
and 51
i 4330
am 392
so 797
far 91
from 2
objecting 1
to 805
dancing 2
myself 1
that 11
i 4330
shall 12
hope 16
to 805
be 1200
with 34
the 193
hands 24
of 109
all 162
my 90
fair 25
cousins 1
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
the 193
evening 3
and 51
i 4330
take 18
this 6
opportunity 2
of 109
soliciting 1
yours 3
miss 71
elizabeth 5
for 484
the 193
two 14
first 8
dances 1
especially 1
a 6799
preference 3
which 2
i 4330
trust 26
my 90
cousin 3
jane 8
will 39
attribute 4
to 805
the 193
right 31
cause 14
and 51
not 85
to 805
any 17
disrespect 7
for 484
her 181
elizabeth 5
felt 5
herself 1
completely 1
taken 1
in 2719
she 199
had 11
fully 1
proposed 1
being 3
engaged 1
by 57
mr 5
for 484
those 1
very 1
dances 1
and 51
to 805
have 11
mr 5
collins 1
instead 1
her 181
liveliness 2
had 11
never 3
been 1
worse 6
timed 1
there 21
was 93
no 896
help 23
for 484
it 67
however 1
mr 5
happiness 2
and 51
her 181
own 9
were 5
perforce 1
delayed 1
a 6799
little 6
longer 1
and 51
mr 5
proposal 3
accepted 1
with 34
as 509
good 28
a 6799
grace 14
as 509
she 199
could 2
she 199
was 93
not 85
the 193
better 7
pleased 1
with 34
his 43
gallantry 2
from 2
the 193
idea 21
it 67
suggested 1
of 109
something 3
more 11
it 67
now 10
first 8
struck 1
her 181
that 11
she 199
was 93
selected 1
from 2
among 1
her 181
sisters 1
as 509
worthy 2
of 109
being 3
mistress 3
of 109
parsonage 3
and 51
of 109
assisting 1
to 805
form 68
a 6799
quadrille 3
table 27
at 272
in 2719
the 193
absence 3
of 109
more 11
eligible 1
visitors 1
the 193
idea 21
soon 3
reached 1
to 805
conviction 3
as 509
she 199
observed 1
his 43
increasing 2
civilities 1
toward 2
herself 1
and 51
heard 1
his 43
frequent 9
attempt 5
at 272
a 6799
compliment 6
on 86
her 181
wit 77
and 51
vivacity 2
and 51
though 12
more 11
astonished 1
than 22
gratified 1
herself 1
by 57
this 6
effect 15
of 109
her 181
charms 1
it 67
was 93
not 85
long 49
before 2
her 181
mother 21
gave 4
her 181
to 805
understand 8
that 11
the 193
probability 2
of 109
their 2
marriage 6
was 93
extremely 1
agreeable 3
to 805
her 181
elizabeth 5
however 1
did 23
not 85
choose 5
to 805
take 18
the 193
hint 13
being 3
well 24
aware 3
that 11
a 6799
serious 4
dispute 7
must 28
be 1200
the 193
consequence 3
of 109
any 17
reply 3
mr 5
collins 1
might 9
never 3
make 17
the 193
offer 10
and 51
till 14
he 962
did 23
it 67
was 93
useless 4
to 805
quarrel 11
about 1
him 9
if 8
there 21
had 11
not 85
been 1
a 6799
ball 77
to 805
prepare 5
for 484
and 51
talk 18
of 109
the 193
younger 1
miss 71
would 5
have 11
been 1
in 2719
a 6799
very 1
pitiable 1
state 41
at 272
this 6
time 45
for 484
from 2
the 193
day 27
of 109
the 193
invitation 6
to 805
the 193
day 27
of 109
the 193
ball 77
there 21
was 93
such 2
a 6799
succession 3
of 109
rain 31
as 509
prevented 1
their 2
walking 2
to 805
once 2
no 896
aunt 6
no 896
officers 1
no 896
news 71
could 2
be 1200
sought 1
after 48
the 193
very 1
shoe 24
roses 1
for 484
were 5
got 14
by 57
proxy 2
even 36
elizabeth 5
might 9
have 11
found 18
some 30
trial 5
of 109
her 181
patience 2
in 2719
weather 33
which 2
totally 1
suspended 1
the 193
improvement 3
of 109
her 181
acquaintance 5
with 34
mr 5
and 51
nothing 5
less 19
than 22
a 6799
dance 7
on 86
tuesday 3
could 2
have 11
made 13
such 2
a 6799
friday 3
saturday 3
sunday 3
and 51
monday 3
endurable 1
to 805
kitty 2
and 51
lydia 4
chapter 3
till 14
elizabeth 5
entered 1
the 193
drawing 3
room 22
at 272
and 51
looked 1
in 2719
vain 8
for 484
mr 5
among 1
the 193
cluster 5
of 109
red 211
coats 1
there 21
assembled 1
a 6799
doubt 15
of 109
his 43
being 3
present 20
had 11
never 3
occurred 1
to 805
her 181
the 193
certainty 2
of 109
meeting 6
him 9
had 11
not 85
been 1
checked 1
by 57
any 17
of 109
those 1
recollections 1
that 11
might 9
not 85
unreasonably 1
have 11
alarmed 1
her 181
she 199
had 11
dressed 1
with 34
more 11
than 22
usual 3
care 47
and 51
prepared 3
in 2719
the 193
highest 1
spirits 1
for 484
the 193
conquest 3
of 109
all 162
that 11
remained 1
of 109
his 43
heart 57
trusting 2
that 11
it 67
was 93
not 85
more 11
than 22
might 9
be 1200
won 33
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
the 193
evening 3
but 82
in 2719
an 970
instant 11
arose 1
the 193
dreadful 4
suspicion 3
of 109
his 43
being 3
purposely 1
omitted 1
for 484
mr 5
darcy's 1
pleasure 5
in 2719
the 193
invitation 6
to 805
the 193
officers 1
and 51
though 12
this 6
was 93
not 85
exactly 1
the 193
case 25
the 193
absolute 7
fact 35
of 109
his 43
absence 3
was 93
pronounced 1
by 57
his 43
friend 14
denny 2
to 805
whom 3
lydia 4
eagerly 1
applied 1
and 51
who 79
told 1
them 9
that 11
had 11
been 1
obliged 1
to 805
go 500
to 805
town 27
on 86
business 13
the 193
day 27
before 2
and 51
was 93
not 85
yet 4
returned 1
adding 1
with 34
a 6799
significant 2
smile 7
i 4330
do 814
not 85
imagine 3
his 43
business 13
would 5
have 11
called 1
him 9
away 1
just 24
now 10
if 8
he 962
had 11
not 85
wanted 1
to 805
avoid 8
a 6799
certain 5
gentleman 3
here 31
this 6
part 102
of 109
his 43
intelligence 2
though 12
unheard 1
by 57
lydia 4
was 93
caught 1
by 57
elizabeth 5
and 51
as 509
it 67
assured 4
her 181
that 11
darcy 2
was 93
not 85
less 19
answerable 1
for 484
absence 3
than 22
if 8
her 181
first 8
surmise 4
had 11
been 1
just 24
every 10
feeling 4
of 109
displeasure 2
against 1
the 193
former 3
was 93
so 797
sharpened 1
by 57
immediate 4
disappointment 3
that 11
she 199
could 2
hardly 1
reply 3
with 34
tolerable 1
civility 2
to 805
the 193
polite 8
inquiries 1
which 2
he 962
directly 1
afterwards 1
approached 1
to 805
make 17
attendance 3
forbearance 2
patience 2
with 34
darcy 2
was 93
injury 2
to 805
she 199
was 93
resolved 1
against 1
any 17
sort 14
of 109
conversation 8
with 34
him 9
and 51
turned 1
away 1
with 34
a 6799
degree 3
of 109
ill 84
which 2
she 199
could 2
not 85
wholly 1
surmount 5
even 36
in 2719
speaking 2
to 805
mr 5
whose 1
blind 22
partiality 2
provoked 1
her 181
but 82
elizabeth 5
was 93
not 85
formed 1
for 484
ill 84
and 51
though 12
every 10
prospect 13
of 109
her 181
own 9
was 93
destroyed 1
for 484
the 193
evening 3
it 67
could 2
not 85
dwell 8
long 49
on 86
her 181
spirits 1
and 51
having 1
told 1
all 162
her 181
griefs 1
to 805
charlotte 4
lucas 1
whom 3
she 199
had 11
not 85
seen 1
for 484
a 6799
week 20
she 199
was 93
soon 3
able 3
to 805
make 17
a 6799
voluntary 2
transition 7
to 805
the 193
oddities 1
of 109
her 181
cousin 3
and 51
to 805
point 22
him 9
out 365
to 805
her 181
particular 13
notice 8
the 193
first 8
two 14
dances 1
however 1
brought 1
a 6799
return 14
of 109
distress 7
they 5
were 5
dances 1
of 109
mortification 2
mr 5
collins 1
awkward 6
and 51
solemn 21
instead 1
of 109
attending 1
and 51
often 4
moving 2
wrong 24
without 1
being 3
aware 3
of 109
it 67
gave 4
her 181
all 162
the 193
shame 14
and 51
misery 2
which 2
a 6799
disagreeable 3
partner 8
for 484
a 6799
couple 7
of 109
dances 1
can 287
give 15
the 193
moment 14
of 109
her 181
release 4
from 2
him 9
was 93
ecstasy 2
she 199
danced 1
next 2
with 34
an 970
officer 3
and 51
had 11
the 193
refreshment 4
of 109
talking 1
of 109
and 51
of 109
hearing 3
that 11
he 962
was 93
universally 1
liked 1
when 6
those 1
dances 1
were 5
over 596
she 199
returned 1
to 805
charlotte 4
lucas 1
and 51
was 93
in 2719
conversation 8
with 34
her 181
when 6
she 199
found 18
herself 1
suddenly 1
addressed 1
by 57
mr 5
darcy 2
who 79
took 1
her 181
so 797
much 2
by 57
surprise 4
in 2719
his 43
application 3
for 484
her 181
hand 137
that 11
without 1
knowing 3
what 14
she 199
did 23
she 199
accepted 1
him 9
he 962
walked 1
away 1
again 2
immediately 1
and 51
she 199
was 93
left 19
to 805
fret 14
over 596
her 181
own 9
want 13
of 109
presence 3
of 109
mind 25
charlotte 4
tried 1
to 805
console 4
her 181
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
you 29
will 39
find 10
him 9
very 1
agreeable 3
heaven 9
forbid 6
that 11
would 5
be 1200
the 193
greatest 1
misfortune 3
of 109
all 162
to 805
find 10
a 6799
man 342
agreeable 3
whom 3
one 19
is 124
determined 2
to 805
hate 14
do 814
not 85
wish 13
me 1041
such 2
an 970
evil 15
when 6
the 193
dancing 2
recommenced 1
however 1
and 51
darcy 2
approached 1
to 805
claim 12
her 181
hand 137
charlotte 4
could 2
not 85
help 23
cautioning 1
her 181
in 2719
a 6799
whisper 8
not 85
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
simpleton 3
and 51
allow 9
her 181
fancy 5
for 484
to 805
make 17
her 181
appear 7
unpleasant 4
in 2719
the 193
eyes 8
of 109
a 6799
man 342
ten 151
times 10
his 43
consequence 3
elizabeth 5
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
took 1
her 181
place 29
in 2719
the 193
set 40
amazed 1
at 272
the 193
dignity 2
to 805
which 2
she 199
was 93
arrived 1
in 2719
being 3
allowed 1
to 805
stand 42
opposite 4
to 805
mr 5
darcy 2
and 51
reading 3
in 2719
her 181
looks 1
their 2
equal 17
amazement 2
in 2719
beholding 1
it 67
they 5
stood 1
for 484
some 30
time 45
without 1
speaking 2
a 6799
word 26
and 51
she 199
began 1
to 805
imagine 3
that 11
their 2
silence 7
was 93
to 805
last 7
through 4
the 193
two 14
dances 1
and 51
at 272
first 8
was 93
resolved 1
not 85
to 805
break 43
it 67
till 14
suddenly 1
fancying 1
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
the 193
greater 1
punishment 3
to 805
her 181
partner 8
to 805
oblige 3
him 9
to 805
talk 18
she 199
made 13
some 30
slight 10
observation 4
on 86
the 193
dance 7
he 962
replied 1
and 51
was 93
again 2
silent 6
after 48
a 6799
pause 4
of 109
some 30
minutes 2
she 199
addressed 1
him 9
a 6799
second 16
time 45
with 34
it 67
is 124
your 4
turn 46
to 805
say 7
something 3
now 10
mr 5
darcy 2
i 4330
talked 1
about 1
the 193
dance 7
and 51
you 29
ought 2
to 805
make 17
some 30
sort 14
of 109
remark 9
on 86
the 193
size 5
of 109
the 193
room 22
or 333
the 193
number 8
of 109
couples 1
he 962
smiled 1
and 51
assured 4
her 181
that 11
whatever 1
she 199
wished 1
him 9
to 805
say 7
should 7
be 1200
said 1
very 1
well 24
that 11
reply 3
will 39
do 814
for 484
the 193
present 20
perhaps 1
by 57
and 51
by 57
i 4330
may 49
observe 6
that 11
private 9
balls 7
are 12
much 2
pleasanter 1
than 22
public 18
ones 2
but 82
now 10
we 444
may 49
be 1200
silent 6
do 814
you 29
talk 18
by 57
rule 7
then 5
while 4
you 29
are 12
dancing 2
sometimes 1
one 19
must 28
speak 12
a 6799
little 6
you 29
know 12
it 67
would 5
look 14
odd 17
to 805
be 1200
entirely 1
silent 6
for 484
half 23
an 970
hour 10
together 3
and 51
yet 4
for 484
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
some 30
conversation 8
ought 2
to 805
be 1200
so 797
arranged 1
as 509
that 11
they 5
may 49
have 11
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
saying 3
as 509
little 6
as 509
possible 3
are 12
you 29
consulting 1
your 4
own 9
feelings 1
in 2719
the 193
present 20
case 25
or 333
do 814
you 29
imagine 3
that 11
you 29
are 12
gratifying 2
mine 26
both 8
replied 1
elizabeth 5
archly 1
for 484
i 4330
have 11
always 1
seen 1
a 6799
great 12
similarity 2
in 2719
the 193
turn 46
of 109
our 3
minds 4
we 444
are 12
each 1
of 109
an 970
unsocial 1
taciturn 4
disposition 3
unwilling 4
to 805
speak 12
unless 1
we 444
expect 20
to 805
say 7
something 3
that 11
will 39
amaze 6
the 193
whole 26
room 22
and 51
be 1200
handed 2
down 90
to 805
posterity 2
with 34
all 162
the 193
clat 5
of 109
a 6799
proverb 5
this 6
is 124
no 896
very 1
striking 3
resemblance 3
of 109
your 4
own 9
character 16
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
said 1
he 962
how 27
near 15
it 67
may 49
be 1200
to 805
mine 26
i 4330
cannot 1
pretend 7
to 805
say 7
you 29
think 8
it 67
a 6799
faithful 6
portrait 8
undoubtedly 1
i 4330
must 28
not 85
decide 6
on 86
my 90
own 9
performance 3
he 962
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
they 5
were 5
again 2
silent 6
till 14
they 5
had 11
gone 4
down 90
the 193
dance 7
when 6
he 962
asked 1
her 181
if 8
she 199
and 51
her 181
sisters 1
did 23
not 85
very 1
often 4
walk 25
to 805
she 199
answered 1
in 2719
the 193
affirmative 4
and 51
unable 1
to 805
resist 17
the 193
temptation 3
added 1
when 6
you 29
met 180
us 70
there 21
the 193
other 5
day 27
we 444
had 11
just 24
been 1
forming 1
a 6799
new 115
acquaintance 5
the 193
effect 15
was 93
immediate 4
a 6799
deeper 1
shade 4
of 109
hauteur 2
overspread 3
his 43
features 1
but 82
he 962
said 1
not 85
a 6799
word 26
and 51
elizabeth 5
though 12
blaming 1
herself 1
for 484
her 181
own 9
weakness 3
could 2
not 85
go 500
on 86
at 272
length 14
darcy 2
spoke 14
and 51
in 2719
a 6799
constrained 1
manner 8
said 1
mr 5
is 124
blessed 4
with 34
such 2
happy 1
manners 1
as 509
may 49
ensure 6
his 43
making 4
friends 4
whether 1
he 962
may 49
be 1200
equally 1
capable 1
of 109
retaining 1
them 9
is 124
less 19
certain 5
he 962
has 41
been 1
so 797
unlucky 1
as 509
to 805
lose 5
your 4
friendship 3
replied 1
elizabeth 5
with 34
emphasis 2
and 51
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
which 2
he 962
is 124
likely 1
to 805
suffer 11
from 2
all 162
his 43
life 44
darcy 2
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
seemed 1
desirous 1
of 109
changing 1
the 193
subject 11
at 272
that 11
moment 14
sir 22
william 3
lucas 1
appeared 1
close 22
to 805
them 9
meaning 11
to 805
pass 66
through 4
the 193
set 40
to 805
the 193
other 5
side 74
of 109
the 193
room 22
but 82
on 86
perceiving 1
mr 5
darcy 2
he 962
stopped 1
with 34
a 6799
bow 58
of 109
superior 5
courtesy 2
to 805
compliment 6
him 9
on 86
his 43
dancing 2
and 51
his 43
partner 8
i 4330
have 11
been 1
most 3
highly 1
gratified 1
indeed 1
my 90
dear 15
sir 22
such 2
very 1
superior 5
dancing 2
is 124
not 85
often 4
seen 1
it 67
is 124
evident 2
that 11
you 29
belong 6
to 805
the 193
first 8
circles 1
allow 9
me 1041
to 805
say 7
however 1
that 11
your 4
fair 25
partner 8
does 5
not 85
disgrace 8
you 29
and 51
that 11
i 4330
must 28
hope 16
to 805
have 11
this 6
pleasure 5
often 4
repeated 2
especially 1
when 6
a 6799
certain 5
desirable 3
event 18
my 90
dear 15
eliza 7
glancing 1
at 272
her 181
sister 9
and 51
shall 12
take 18
place 29
what 14
congratulations 1
will 39
then 5
flow 27
in 2719
i 4330
appeal 6
to 805
mr 5
darcy 2
but 82
let 50
me 1041
not 85
interrupt 11
you 29
sir 22
you 29
will 39
not 85
thank 15
me 1041
for 484
detaining 1
you 29
from 2
the 193
bewitching 2
converse 5
of 109
that 11
young 9
lady 18
whose 1
bright 17
eyes 8
are 12
also 3
upbraiding 1
me 1041
the 193
latter 3
part 102
of 109
this 6
address 9
was 93
scarcely 1
heard 1
by 57
darcy 2
but 82
sir 22
allusion 3
to 805
his 43
friend 14
seemed 1
to 805
strike 14
him 9
forcibly 1
and 51
his 43
eyes 8
were 5
directed 1
with 34
a 6799
very 1
serious 4
expression 11
towards 1
and 51
jane 8
who 79
were 5
dancing 2
together 3
recovering 1
himself 1
however 1
shortly 1
he 962
turned 1
to 805
his 43
partner 8
and 51
said 1
sir 22
interruption 3
has 41
made 13
me 1041
forget 8
what 14
we 444
were 5
talking 1
of 109
i 4330
do 814
not 85
think 8
we 444
were 5
speaking 2
at 272
all 162
sir 22
william 3
could 2
not 85
have 11
interrupted 1
two 14
people 4
in 2719
the 193
room 22
who 79
had 11
less 19
to 805
say 7
for 484
themselves 1
we 444
have 11
tried 1
two 14
or 333
three 12
subjects 1
already 1
without 1
success 13
and 51
what 14
we 444
are 12
to 805
talk 18
of 109
next 2
i 4330
cannot 1
imagine 3
what 14
think 8
you 29
of 109
books 15
said 1
he 962
smiling 2
books 15
oh 17
no 896
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
we 444
never 3
read 49
the 193
same 5
or 333
not 85
with 34
the 193
same 5
feelings 1
i 4330
am 392
sorry 1
you 29
think 8
so 797
but 82
if 8
that 11
be 1200
the 193
case 25
there 21
can 287
at 272
least 3
be 1200
no 896
want 13
of 109
subject 11
we 444
may 49
compare 4
our 3
different 11
opinions 1
no 896
i 4330
cannot 1
talk 18
of 109
books 15
in 2719
a 6799
ball 77
room 22
my 90
head 140
is 124
always 1
full 16
of 109
something 3
else 2
the 193
present 20
always 1
occupies 1
you 29
in 2719
such 2
scenes 1
does 5
it 67
said 1
he 962
with 34
a 6799
look 14
of 109
doubt 15
yes 16
always 1
she 199
replied 1
without 1
knowing 3
what 14
she 199
said 1
for 484
her 181
thoughts 1
had 11
wandered 1
far 91
from 2
the 193
subject 11
as 509
soon 3
afterwards 1
appeared 1
by 57
her 181
suddenly 1
exclaiming 1
i 4330
remember 4
hearing 3
you 29
once 2
say 7
mr 5
darcy 2
that 11
you 29
hardly 1
ever 33
forgave 1
that 11
your 4
resentment 3
once 2
created 1
was 93
you 29
are 12
very 1
cautious 4
i 4330
suppose 4
as 509
to 805
its 2
being 3
created 1
i 4330
am 392
said 1
he 962
with 34
a 6799
firm 16
voice 8
and 51
never 3
allow 9
yourself 1
to 805
be 1200
blinded 1
by 57
prejudice 4
i 4330
hope 16
not 85
it 67
is 124
particularly 1
incumbent 3
on 86
those 1
who 79
never 3
change 21
their 2
opinion 4
to 805
be 1200
secure 6
of 109
judging 1
properly 1
at 272
first 8
may 49
i 4330
ask 6
to 805
what 14
these 4
questions 1
tend 46
merely 1
to 805
the 193
illustration 3
of 109
your 4
character 16
said 1
she 199
to 805
shake 19
off 100
her 181
gravity 2
i 4330
am 392
trying 2
to 805
make 17
it 67
out 365
and 51
what 14
is 124
your 4
success 13
she 199
shook 1
her 181
head 140
i 4330
do 814
not 85
get 13
on 86
at 272
all 162
i 4330
hear 76
such 2
different 11
accounts 1
of 109
you 29
as 509
puzzle 9
me 1041
exceedingly 1
i 4330
can 287
readily 1
believe 6
answered 1
he 962
gravely 1
that 11
reports 1
may 49
vary 2
greatly 1
with 34
respect 18
to 805
me 1041
and 51
i 4330
could 2
wish 13
miss 71
bennet 1
that 11
you 29
were 5
not 85
to 805
sketch 18
my 90
character 16
at 272
the 193
present 20
moment 14
as 509
there 21
is 124
reason 13
to 805
fear 14
that 11
the 193
performance 3
would 5
reflect 12
no 896
credit 12
on 86
either 1
but 82
if 8
i 4330
do 814
not 85
take 18
your 4
likeness 3
now 10
i 4330
may 49
never 3
have 11
another 1
opportunity 2
i 4330
would 5
by 57
no 896
means 1
suspend 7
any 17
pleasure 5
of 109
yours 3
he 962
coldly 1
replied 1
she 199
said 1
no 896
more 11
and 51
they 5
went 1
down 90
the 193
other 5
dance 7
and 51
parted 1
in 2719
silence 7
and 51
on 86
each 1
side 74
dissatisfied 1
though 12
not 85
to 805
an 970
equal 17
degree 3
for 484
in 2719
darcy's 1
breast 21
there 21
was 93
a 6799
tolerably 1
powerful 2
feeling 4
towards 1
her 181
which 2
soon 3
procured 1
her 181
pardon 10
and 51
directed 1
all 162
his 43
anger 5
against 1
another 1
they 5
had 11
not 85
long 49
separated 1
when 6
miss 71
came 36
towards 1
her 181
and 51
with 34
an 970
expression 11
of 109
civil 15
disdain 7
accosted 1
her 181
so 797
miss 71
eliza 7
i 4330
hear 76
you 29
are 12
quite 1
delighted 2
with 34
george 6
your 4
sister 9
has 41
been 1
talking 1
to 805
me 1041
about 1
him 9
and 51
asking 1
me 1041
a 6799
thousand 7
questions 1
and 51
i 4330
find 10
that 11
the 193
young 9
man 342
quite 1
forgot 2
to 805
tell 16
you 29
among 1
his 43
other 5
communication 3
that 11
he 962
was 93
the 193
son 70
of 109
old 21
the 193
late 23
mr 5
darcy's 1
steward 10
let 50
me 1041
recommend 8
you 29
however 1
as 509
a 6799
friend 14
not 85
to 805
give 15
implicit 4
confidence 3
to 805
all 162
his 43
assertions 1
for 484
as 509
to 805
mr 5
darcy's 1
using 1
him 9
ill 84
it 67
is 124
perfectly 1
false 12
for 484
on 86
the 193
contrary 2
he 962
has 41
always 1
been 1
remarkably 1
kind 31
to 805
him 9
though 12
george 6
has 41
treated 1
mr 5
darcy 2
in 2719
a 6799
most 3
infamous 2
manner 8
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
the 193
particulars 1
but 82
i 4330
know 12
very 1
well 24
that 11
mr 5
darcy 2
is 124
not 85
in 2719
the 193
least 3
to 805
blame 12
that 11
he 962
cannot 1
bear 30
to 805
hear 76
george 6
mentioned 1
and 51
that 11
though 12
my 90
brother 9
thought 11
that 11
he 962
could 2
not 85
well 24
avoid 8
including 1
him 9
in 2719
his 43
invitation 6
to 805
the 193
officers 1
he 962
was 93
excessively 1
glad 30
to 805
find 10
that 11
he 962
had 11
taken 1
himself 1
out 365
of 109
the 193
way 27
his 43
coming 3
into 26
the 193
country 12
at 272
all 162
is 124
a 6799
most 3
insolent 2
thing 15
indeed 1
and 51
i 4330
wonder 17
how 27
he 962
could 2
presume 3
to 805
do 814
it 67
i 4330
pity 4
you 29
miss 71
eliza 7
for 484
this 6
discovery 2
of 109
your 4
guilt 9
but 82
really 1
considering 1
his 43
descent 3
one 19
could 2
not 85
expect 20
much 2
better 7
his 43
guilt 9
and 51
his 43
descent 3
appear 7
by 57
your 4
account 14
to 805
be 1200
the 193
same 5
said 1
elizabeth 5
angrily 1
for 484
i 4330
have 11
heard 1
you 29
accuse 6
him 9
of 109
nothing 5
worse 6
than 22
of 109
being 3
the 193
son 70
of 109
mr 5
darcy's 1
steward 10
and 51
of 109
that 11
i 4330
can 287
assure 6
you 29
he 962
informed 1
me 1041
himself 1
i 4330
beg 59
your 4
pardon 10
replied 1
miss 71
turning 3
away 1
with 34
a 6799
sneer 7
excuse 4
my 90
interference 2
it 67
was 93
kindly 1
meant 3
insolent 2
girl 14
said 1
elizabeth 5
to 805
herself 1
you 29
are 12
much 2
mistaken 2
if 8
you 29
expect 20
to 805
influence 4
me 1041
by 57
such 2
a 6799
paltry 1
attack 8
as 509
this 6
i 4330
see 70
nothing 5
in 2719
it 67
but 82
your 4
own 9
ignorance 2
and 51
the 193
malice 2
of 109
mr 5
darcy 2
she 199
then 5
sought 1
her 181
eldest 1
sister 9
who 79
had 11
undertaken 1
to 805
make 17
inquiries 1
on 86
the 193
same 5
subject 11
of 109
jane 8
met 180
her 181
with 34
a 6799
smile 7
of 109
such 2
sweet 33
complacency 2
a 6799
glow 14
of 109
such 2
happy 1
expression 11
as 509
sufficiently 1
marked 2
how 27
well 24
she 199
was 93
satisfied 1
with 34
the 193
occurrences 1
of 109
the 193
evening 3
elizabeth 5
instantly 1
read 49
her 181
feelings 1
and 51
at 272
that 11
moment 14
solicitude 2
for 484
resentment 3
against 1
his 43
enemies 1
and 51
everything 2
else 2
gave 4
way 27
before 2
the 193
hope 16
of 109
being 3
in 2719
the 193
fairest 1
way 27
for 484
happiness 2
i 4330
want 13
to 805
know 12
said 1
she 199
with 34
a 6799
countenance 4
no 896
less 19
smiling 2
than 22
her 181
sister's 1
what 14
you 29
have 11
about 1
mr 5
but 82
perhaps 1
you 29
have 11
been 1
too 50
pleasantly 1
engaged 1
to 805
think 8
of 109
any 17
third 4
person 33
in 2719
which 2
case 25
you 29
may 49
be 1200
sure 11
of 109
my 90
pardon 10
no 896
replied 1
jane 8
i 4330
have 11
not 85
forgotten 1
him 9
but 82
i 4330
have 11
nothing 5
satisfactory 1
to 805
tell 16
you 29
mr 5
does 5
not 85
know 12
the 193
whole 26
of 109
his 43
history 2
and 51
is 124
quite 1
ignorant 2
of 109
the 193
circumstances 1
which 2
have 11
principally 1
offended 1
mr 5
darcy 2
but 82
he 962
will 39
vouch 11
for 484
the 193
good 28
conduct 21
the 193
probity 2
and 51
of 109
his 43
friend 14
and 51
is 124
perfectly 1
convinced 1
that 11
mr 5
has 41
deserved 2
much 2
less 19
attention 3
from 2
mr 5
darcy 2
than 22
he 962
has 41
received 1
and 51
i 4330
am 392
sorry 1
to 805
say 7
by 57
his 43
account 14
as 509
well 24
as 509
his 43
sister's 1
mr 5
is 124
by 57
no 896
means 1
a 6799
respectable 1
young 9
man 342
i 4330
am 392
afraid 1
he 962
has 41
been 1
very 1
imprudent 2
and 51
has 41
deserved 2
to 805
lose 5
mr 5
darcy's 1
regard 7
mr 5
does 5
not 85
know 12
mr 5
himself 1
no 896
he 962
never 3
saw 24
him 9
till 14
the 193
other 5
morning 3
at 272
this 6
account 14
then 5
is 124
what 14
he 962
has 41
received 1
from 2
mr 5
darcy 2
i 4330
am 392
satisfied 1
but 82
what 14
does 5
he 962
say 7
of 109
the 193
living 5
he 962
does 5
not 85
exactly 1
recollect 7
the 193
circumstances 1
though 12
he 962
has 41
heard 1
them 9
from 2
mr 5
darcy 2
more 11
than 22
once 2
but 82
he 962
believes 1
that 11
it 67
was 93
left 19
to 805
him 9
conditionally 1
only 1
i 4330
have 11
not 85
a 6799
doubt 15
of 109
mr 5
sincerity 2
said 1
elizabeth 5
warmly 1
but 82
you 29
must 28
excuse 4
my 90
not 85
being 3
convinced 1
by 57
assurances 1
only 1
mr 5
defense 8
of 109
his 43
friend 14
was 93
a 6799
very 1
able 3
one 19
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
but 82
since 7
he 962
is 124
unacquainted 1
with 34
several 3
parts 1
of 109
the 193
story 13
and 51
has 41
the 193
rest 110
from 2
that 11
friend 14
himself 1
i 4330
shall 12
venture 8
to 805
still 13
think 8
of 109
both 8
gentlemen 1
as 509
i 4330
did 23
before 2
she 199
then 5
changed 1
the 193
discourse 4
to 805
one 19
more 11
gratifying 2
to 805
each 1
and 51
on 86
which 2
there 21
could 2
be 1200
no 896
difference 3
of 109
sentiment 18
elizabeth 5
listened 1
with 34
delight 8
to 805
the 193
happy 1
though 12
modest 5
hopes 1
which 2
jane 8
entertained 1
of 109
mr 5
regard 7
and 51
said 1
all 162
in 2719
her 181
power 19
to 805
heighten 4
her 181
confidence 3
in 2719
it 67
on 86
their 2
being 3
joined 1
by 57
mr 5
himself 1
elizabeth 5
withdrew 1
to 805
miss 71
lucas 1
to 805
whose 1
inquiry 2
after 48
the 193
pleasantness 2
of 109
her 181
last 7
partner 8
she 199
had 11
scarcely 1
replied 1
before 2
mr 5
collins 1
came 36
up 194
to 805
them 9
and 51
told 1
her 181
with 34
great 12
exultation 2
that 11
he 962
had 11
just 24
been 1
so 797
fortunate 2
as 509
to 805
make 17
a 6799
most 3
important 2
discovery 2
i 4330
have 11
found 18
out 365
said 1
he 962
by 57
a 6799
singular 7
accident 7
that 11
there 21
is 124
now 10
in 2719
the 193
room 22
a 6799
near 15
relation 7
of 109
my 90
patroness 3
i 4330
happened 1
to 805
overhear 4
the 193
gentleman 3
himself 1
mentioning 1
to 805
the 193
young 9
lady 18
who 79
does 5
the 193
of 109
the 193
house 87
the 193
names 4
of 109
his 43
cousin 3
miss 71
de 2452
and 51
of 109
her 181
mother 21
lady 18
catherine 2
how 27
wonderfully 1
these 4
sort 14
of 109
things 1
occur 7
who 79
would 5
have 11
thought 11
of 109
my 90
meeting 6
with 34
perhaps 1
a 6799
nephew 3
of 109
lady 18
catherine 2
de 2452
in 2719
this 6
assembly 8
i 4330
am 392
most 3
thankful 4
that 11
the 193
discovery 2
is 124
made 13
in 2719
time 45
for 484
me 1041
to 805
pay 52
my 90
respects 1
to 805
him 9
which 2
i 4330
am 392
now 10
going 3
to 805
do 814
and 51
trust 26
he 962
will 39
excuse 4
my 90
not 85
having 1
done 3
it 67
before 2
my 90
total 17
ignorance 2
of 109
the 193
connection 3
must 28
plead 10
my 90
apology 2
you 29
are 12
not 85
going 3
to 805
introduce 3
yourself 1
to 805
mr 5
darcy 2
indeed 1
i 4330
am 392
i 4330
shall 12
entreat 8
his 43
pardon 10
for 484
not 85
having 1
done 3
it 67
earlier 1
i 4330
believe 6
him 9
to 805
be 1200
lady 18
catherine's 1
nephew 3
it 67
will 39
be 1200
in 2719
my 90
power 19
to 805
assure 6
him 9
that 11
her 181
ladyship 3
was 93
quite 1
well 24
yesterday 3
elizabeth 5
tried 1
hard 70
to 805
dissuade 3
him 9
from 2
such 2
a 6799
scheme 7
assuring 1
him 9
that 11
mr 5
darcy 2
would 5
consider 13
his 43
addressing 1
him 9
without 1
introduction 3
as 509
an 970
impertinent 2
freedom 3
rather 2
than 22
a 6799
compliment 6
to 805
his 43
aunt 6
that 11
it 67
was 93
not 85
in 2719
the 193
least 3
necessary 2
there 21
should 7
be 1200
any 17
notice 8
on 86
either 1
side 74
and 51
that 11
if 8
it 67
were 5
it 67
must 28
belong 6
to 805
mr 5
darcy 2
the 193
superior 5
in 2719
consequence 3
to 805
begin 8
the 193
acquaintance 5
mr 5
collins 1
listened 1
to 805
her 181
with 34
the 193
determined 2
air 129
of 109
following 3
his 43
own 9
inclination 3
and 51
when 6
she 199
ceased 1
speaking 2
replied 1
thus 1
my 90
dear 15
miss 71
elizabeth 5
i 4330
have 11
the 193
highest 1
opinion 4
in 2719
the 193
world 12
in 2719
your 4
excellent 2
in 2719
all 162
matters 1
within 3
the 193
scope 5
of 109
your 4
understanding 4
but 82
permit 5
me 1041
to 805
say 7
that 11
there 21
must 28
be 1200
a 6799
wide 15
difference 3
between 1
the 193
established 1
forms 1
of 109
ceremony 2
the 193
laity 2
and 51
those 1
which 2
regulate 3
the 193
clergy 8
for 484
give 15
me 1041
leave 14
to 805
observe 6
that 11
i 4330
consider 13
the 193
clerical 4
office 11
as 509
equal 17
in 2719
point 22
of 109
dignity 2
with 34
the 193
highest 1
rank 19
in 2719
the 193
kingdom 3
provided 1
that 11
a 6799
proper 9
humility 2
of 109
is 124
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
maintained 1
you 29
must 28
therefore 1
allow 9
me 1041
to 805
follow 11
the 193
dictates 1
of 109
my 90
conscience 4
on 86
this 6
occasion 7
which 2
leads 1
me 1041
to 805
perform 10
what 14
i 4330
look 14
on 86
as 509
a 6799
point 22
of 109
duty 2
pardon 10
me 1041
for 484
neglecting 1
to 805
profit 19
by 57
your 4
advice 2
which 2
on 86
every 10
other 5
subject 11
shall 12
be 1200
my 90
constant 7
guide 16
though 12
in 2719
the 193
case 25
before 2
us 70
i 4330
consider 13
myself 1
more 11
fitted 1
by 57
education 9
and 51
habitual 4
study 3
to 805
decide 6
on 86
what 14
is 124
right 31
than 22
a 6799
young 9
lady 18
like 22
yourself 1
and 51
with 34
a 6799
low 46
bow 58
he 962
left 19
her 181
to 805
attack 8
mr 5
darcy 2
whose 1
reception 6
of 109
his 43
advances 1
she 199
eagerly 1
watched 1
and 51
whose 1
astonishment 2
at 272
being 3
so 797
addressed 1
was 93
very 1
evident 2
her 181
cousin 3
prefaced 1
his 43
speech 13
with 34
a 6799
solemn 21
bow 58
and 51
though 12
she 199
could 2
not 85
hear 76
a 6799
word 26
of 109
it 67
she 199
felt 5
as 509
if 8
hearing 3
it 67
all 162
and 51
saw 24
in 2719
the 193
motion 9
of 109
his 43
lips 8
the 193
words 5
apology 2
and 51
lady 18
catherine 2
de 2452
it 67
vexed 1
her 181
to 805
see 70
him 9
expose 4
himself 1
to 805
such 2
a 6799
man 342
mr 5
darcy 2
was 93
eyeing 1
him 9
with 34
unrestrained 1
wonder 17
and 51
when 6
at 272
last 7
mr 5
collins 1
allowed 1
him 9
time 45
to 805
speak 12
replied 1
with 34
an 970
air 129
of 109
distant 2
civility 2
mr 5
collins 1
however 1
was 93
not 85
discouraged 1
from 2
speaking 2
again 2
and 51
mr 5
darcy's 1
contempt 8
seemed 1
abundantly 1
increasing 2
with 34
the 193
length 14
of 109
his 43
second 16
speech 13
and 51
at 272
the 193
end 92
of 109
it 67
he 962
only 1
made 13
him 9
a 6799
slight 10
bow 58
and 51
moved 1
another 1
way 27
mr 5
collins 1
then 5
returned 1
to 805
elizabeth 5
i 4330
have 11
no 896
reason 13
i 4330
assure 6
you 29
said 1
he 962
to 805
be 1200
dissatisfied 1
with 34
my 90
reception 6
mr 5
darcy 2
seemed 1
much 2
pleased 1
with 34
the 193
attention 3
he 962
answered 1
me 1041
with 34
the 193
utmost 2
civility 2
and 51
even 36
paid 1
me 1041
the 193
compliment 6
of 109
saying 3
that 11
he 962
was 93
so 797
well 24
convinced 1
of 109
lady 18
catherine's 1
discernment 2
as 509
to 805
be 1200
certain 5
she 199
could 2
never 3
bestow 7
a 6799
unworthily 1
it 67
was 93
really 1
a 6799
very 1
handsome 6
thought 11
upon 1
the 193
whole 26
i 4330
am 392
much 2
pleased 1
with 34
him 9
as 509
elizabeth 5
had 11
no 896
longer 1
any 17
interest 6
of 109
her 181
own 9
to 805
pursue 6
she 199
turned 1
her 181
attention 3
almost 1
entirely 1
on 86
her 181
sister 9
and 51
mr 5
and 51
the 193
train 22
of 109
agreeable 3
reflections 1
which 2
her 181
observations 1
gave 4
birth 23
to 805
made 13
her 181
perhaps 1
almost 1
as 509
happy 1
as 509
jane 8
she 199
saw 24
her 181
in 2719
idea 21
settled 1
in 2719
that 11
very 1
house 87
in 2719
all 162
the 193
felicity 2
which 2
a 6799
marriage 6
of 109
true 9
affection 5
could 2
bestow 7
and 51
she 199
felt 5
capable 1
under 288
such 2
circumstances 1
of 109
even 36
to 805
like 22
two 14
sisters 1
her 181
mother's 1
thoughts 1
she 199
plainly 1
saw 24
were 5
bent 8
the 193
same 5
way 27
and 51
she 199
determined 2
not 85
to 805
venture 8
near 15
her 181
lest 5
she 199
might 9
hear 76
too 50
much 2
when 6
they 5
sat 92
down 90
to 805
supper 4
therefore 1
she 199
considered 1
it 67
a 6799
most 3
unlucky 1
perverseness 2
which 2
placed 1
them 9
within 3
one 19
of 109
each 1
other 5
and 51
deeply 1
was 93
she 199
vexed 1
to 805
find 10
that 11
her 181
mother 21
was 93
talking 1
to 805
that 11
one 19
person 33
lady 18
lucas 1
freely 1
openly 1
and 51
of 109
nothing 5
else 2
but 82
her 181
expectation 3
that 11
jane 8
would 5
soon 3
be 1200
married 3
to 805
mr 5
it 67
was 93
an 970
animating 1
subject 11
and 51
mrs 1
bennet 1
seemed 1
incapable 1
of 109
fatigue 5
while 4
enumerating 1
the 193
advantages 1
of 109
the 193
match 25
his 43
being 3
such 2
a 6799
charming 2
young 9
man 342
and 51
so 797
rich 19
and 51
living 5
but 82
three 12
miles 4
from 2
them 9
were 5
the 193
first 8
points 1
of 109
self 11
and 51
then 5
it 67
was 93
such 2
a 6799
comfort 14
to 805
think 8
how 27
fond 17
the 193
two 14
sisters 1
were 5
of 109
jane 8
and 51
to 805
be 1200
certain 5
that 11
they 5
must 28
desire 6
the 193
connection 3
as 509
much 2
as 509
she 199
could 2
do 814
it 67
was 93
moreover 1
such 2
a 6799
promising 2
thing 15
for 484
her 181
younger 1
daughters 1
as 509
marrying 1
so 797
greatly 1
must 28
throw 14
them 9
in 2719
the 193
way 27
of 109
other 5
rich 19
men 140
and 51
lastly 1
it 67
was 93
so 797
pleasant 9
at 272
her 181
time 45
of 109
life 44
to 805
be 1200
able 3
to 805
consign 13
her 181
single 15
daughters 1
to 805
the 193
care 47
of 109
their 2
sister 9
that 11
she 199
might 9
not 85
be 1200
obliged 1
to 805
go 500
into 26
company 2
more 11
than 22
she 199
liked 1
it 67
was 93
necessary 2
to 805
make 17
this 6
circumstance 4
a 6799
matter 7
of 109
pleasure 5
because 1
on 86
such 2
occasions 1
it 67
is 124
the 193
etiquette 2
but 82
no 896
one 19
was 93
less 19
likely 1
than 22
mrs 1
bennet 1
to 805
find 10
comfort 14
in 2719
staying 1
home 90
at 272
any 17
period 16
of 109
her 181
life 44
she 199
concluded 1
with 34
many 2
good 28
wishes 1
that 11
lady 18
lucas 1
might 9
soon 3
be 1200
equally 1
fortunate 2
though 12
evidently 1
and 51
triumphantly 1
believing 1
there 21
was 93
no 896
chance 20
of 109
it 67
in 2719
vain 8
did 23
elizabeth 5
to 805
check 40
the 193
rapidity 2
of 109
her 181
mother's 1
words 5
or 333
persuade 6
her 181
to 805
describe 6
her 181
felicity 2
in 2719
a 6799
less 19
audible 3
whisper 8
for 484
to 805
her 181
inexpressible 1
vexation 3
she 199
could 2
perceive 3
that 11
the 193
chief 14
of 109
it 67
was 93
overheard 1
by 57
mr 5
darcy 2
who 79
sat 92
opposite 4
to 805
them 9
her 181
mother 21
only 1
scolded 1
her 181
for 484
being 3
nonsensical 2
what 14
is 124
mr 5
darcy 2
to 805
me 1041
pray 9
that 11
i 4330
should 7
be 1200
afraid 1
of 109
him 9
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
we 444
owe 5
him 9
no 896
such 2
particular 13
civility 2
as 509
to 805
be 1200
obliged 1
to 805
say 7
nothing 5
he 962
may 49
not 85
like 22
to 805
hear 76
for 484
heaven's 1
sake 2
madam 5
speak 12
lower 9
what 14
advantage 6
can 287
it 67
be 1200
for 484
you 29
to 805
offend 7
mr 5
darcy 2
you 29
will 39
never 3
recommend 8
yourself 1
to 805
his 43
friend 14
by 57
so 797
doing 3
nothing 5
that 11
she 199
could 2
say 7
however 1
had 11
any 17
influence 4
her 181
mother 21
would 5
talk 18
of 109
her 181
views 1
in 2719
the 193
same 5
intelligible 1
tone 12
elizabeth 5
blushed 1
and 51
blushed 1
again 2
with 34
shame 14
and 51
vexation 3
she 199
could 2
not 85
help 23
frequently 1
glancing 1
her 181
eye 57
at 272
mr 5
darcy 2
though 12
every 10
glance 4
convinced 1
her 181
of 109
what 14
she 199
dreaded 1
for 484
though 12
he 962
was 93
not 85
always 1
looking 1
at 272
her 181
mother 21
she 199
was 93
convinced 1
that 11
his 43
attention 3
was 93
invariably 1
fixed 2
by 57
her 181
the 193
expression 11
of 109
his 43
face 19
changed 1
gradually 1
from 2
indignant 2
contempt 8
to 805
a 6799
composed 2
and 51
steady 3
gravity 2
at 272
length 14
however 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
had 11
no 896
more 11
to 805
say 7
and 51
lady 18
lucas 1
who 79
had 11
been 1
long 49
yawning 1
at 272
the 193
repetition 3
of 109
delights 1
which 2
she 199
saw 24
no 896
likelihood 3
of 109
sharing 1
was 93
left 19
to 805
the 193
comforts 1
of 109
cold 9
ham 75
and 51
chicken 12
elizabeth 5
now 10
began 1
to 805
revive 3
but 82
not 85
long 49
was 93
the 193
interval 3
of 109
for 484
when 6
supper 4
was 93
over 596
singing 2
was 93
talked 1
of 109
and 51
she 199
had 11
the 193
mortification 2
of 109
seeing 2
mary 13
after 48
very 1
little 6
entreaty 2
preparing 1
to 805
oblige 3
the 193
company 2
by 57
many 2
significant 2
looks 1
and 51
silent 6
entreaties 1
did 23
she 199
to 805
prevent 13
such 2
a 6799
proof 11
of 109
complaisance 2
but 82
in 2719
vain 8
mary 13
would 5
not 85
understand 8
them 9
such 2
an 970
opportunity 2
of 109
exhibiting 1
was 93
delightful 2
to 805
her 181
and 51
she 199
began 1
her 181
song 26
elizabeth's 1
eyes 8
were 5
fixed 2
on 86
her 181
with 34
most 3
painful 6
sensations 1
and 51
she 199
watched 1
her 181
progress 14
through 4
the 193
several 3
stanzas 1
with 34
an 970
impatience 3
which 2
was 93
very 1
ill 84
rewarded 1
at 272
their 2
close 22
for 484
mary 13
on 86
receiving 1
the 193
thanks 4
of 109
the 193
table 27
the 193
hint 13
of 109
a 6799
hope 16
that 11
she 199
might 9
be 1200
prevailed 1
on 86
to 805
them 9
again 2
after 48
the 193
pause 4
of 109
half 23
a 6799
minute 12
began 1
another 1
mary's 1
powers 1
were 5
by 57
no 896
means 1
fitted 1
for 484
such 2
a 6799
display 6
her 181
voice 8
was 93
weak 20
and 51
her 181
manner 8
affected 2
elizabeth 5
was 93
in 2719
agonies 1
she 199
looked 1
at 272
jane 8
to 805
see 70
how 27
she 199
bore 13
it 67
but 82
jane 8
was 93
very 1
composedly 1
talking 1
to 805
she 199
looked 1
at 272
his 43
two 14
sisters 1
and 51
saw 24
them 9
making 4
signs 1
of 109
derision 2
at 272
each 1
other 5
and 51
at 272
darcy 2
who 79
continued 1
however 1
imperturbably 1
grave 28
she 199
looked 1
at 272
her 181
father 12
to 805
entreat 8
his 43
interference 2
lest 5
mary 13
should 7
be 1200
singing 2
all 162
night 61
he 962
took 1
the 193
hint 13
and 51
when 6
mary 13
had 11
finished 1
her 181
second 16
song 26
said 1
aloud 1
that 11
will 39
do 814
extremely 1
well 24
child 28
you 29
have 11
delighted 2
us 70
long 49
enough 2
let 50
the 193
other 5
young 9
ladies 1
have 11
time 45
to 805
exhibit 16
mary 13
though 12
pretending 1
not 85
to 805
hear 76
was 93
somewhat 2
disconcerted 1
and 51
elizabeth 5
sorry 1
for 484
her 181
and 51
sorry 1
for 484
her 181
father's 1
speech 13
was 93
afraid 1
her 181
anxiety 2
had 11
done 3
no 896
good 28
others 1
of 109
the 193
party 3
were 5
now 10
applied 1
to 805
if 8
i 4330
said 1
mr 5
collins 1
were 5
so 797
fortunate 2
as 509
to 805
be 1200
able 3
to 805
sing 52
i 4330
should 7
have 11
great 12
pleasure 5
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
in 2719
obliging 2
the 193
company 2
with 34
an 970
air 129
for 484
i 4330
consider 13
music 24
as 509
a 6799
very 1
innocent 4
diversion 4
and 51
perfectly 1
compatible 3
with 34
the 193
profession 14
of 109
a 6799
clergyman 2
i 4330
do 814
not 85
mean 36
however 1
to 805
assert 11
that 11
we 444
can 287
be 1200
justified 1
in 2719
devoting 1
too 50
much 2
of 109
our 3
time 45
to 805
music 24
for 484
there 21
are 12
certainly 1
other 5
things 1
to 805
be 1200
attended 1
to 805
the 193
rector 6
of 109
a 6799
parish 6
has 41
much 2
to 805
do 814
in 2719
the 193
first 8
place 29
he 962
must 28
make 17
such 2
an 970
agreement 3
for 484
tithes 1
as 509
may 49
be 1200
beneficial 2
to 805
himself 1
and 51
not 85
offensive 6
to 805
his 43
patron 21
he 962
must 28
write 5
his 43
own 9
sermons 1
and 51
the 193
time 45
that 11
remains 1
will 39
not 85
be 1200
too 50
much 2
for 484
his 43
parish 6
duties 1
and 51
the 193
care 47
and 51
improvement 3
of 109
his 43
dwelling 3
which 2
he 962
cannot 1
be 1200
excused 1
from 2
making 4
as 509
comfortable 3
as 509
possible 3
and 51
i 4330
do 814
not 85
think 8
it 67
of 109
light 42
importance 2
that 11
he 962
should 7
have 11
attentive 4
and 51
conciliatory 1
manners 1
towards 1
everybody 2
especially 1
towards 1
those 1
to 805
whom 3
he 962
owes 1
his 43
preferment 2
i 4330
cannot 1
acquit 7
him 9
of 109
that 11
duty 2
nor 102
could 2
i 4330
think 8
well 24
of 109
the 193
man 342
who 79
should 7
omit 4
an 970
occasion 7
of 109
testifying 1
his 43
respect 18
towards 1
anybody 2
connected 1
with 34
the 193
family 2
and 51
with 34
a 6799
bow 58
to 805
mr 5
darcy 2
he 962
concluded 1
his 43
speech 13
which 2
had 11
been 1
spoken 1
so 797
loud 16
as 509
to 805
be 1200
heard 1
by 57
half 23
the 193
room 22
many 2
stared 1
many 2
smiled 1
but 82
no 896
one 19
looked 1
more 11
amused 1
than 22
mr 5
bennet 1
himself 1
while 4
his 43
wife 6
seriously 1
commended 1
mr 5
collins 1
for 484
having 1
spoken 1
so 797
sensibly 1
and 51
observed 1
in 2719
a 6799
half 23
whisper 8
to 805
lady 18
lucas 1
that 11
he 962
was 93
a 6799
remarkably 1
clever 6
good 28
kind 31
of 109
young 9
man 342
to 805
elizabeth 5
it 67
appeared 1
that 11
had 11
her 181
family 2
made 13
an 970
agreement 3
to 805
expose 4
themselves 1
as 509
much 2
as 509
they 5
could 2
during 1
the 193
evening 3
it 67
would 5
have 11
been 1
impossible 2
for 484
them 9
to 805
play 73
their 2
parts 1
with 34
more 11
spirit 20
or 333
finer 3
success 13
and 51
happy 1
did 23
she 199
think 8
it 67
for 484
and 51
her 181
sister 9
that 11
some 30
of 109
the 193
exhibition 8
had 11
escaped 1
his 43
notice 8
and 51
that 11
his 43
feelings 1
were 5
not 85
of 109
a 6799
sort 14
to 805
be 1200
much 2
distressed 1
by 57
the 193
folly 2
which 2
he 962
must 28
have 11
witnessed 1
that 11
his 43
two 14
sisters 1
and 51
mr 5
darcy 2
however 1
should 7
have 11
such 2
an 970
opportunity 2
of 109
ridiculing 1
her 181
relations 4
was 93
bad 33
enough 2
and 51
she 199
could 2
not 85
determine 7
whether 1
the 193
silent 6
contempt 8
of 109
the 193
gentleman 3
or 333
the 193
insolent 2
smiles 1
of 109
the 193
ladies 1
were 5
more 11
intolerable 1
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
evening 3
brought 1
her 181
little 6
amusement 3
she 199
was 93
teased 1
by 57
mr 5
collins 1
who 79
continued 1
most 3
by 57
her 181
side 74
and 51
though 12
he 962
could 2
not 85
prevail 4
on 86
her 181
to 805
dance 7
with 34
him 9
again 2
put 47
it 67
out 365
of 109
her 181
power 19
to 805
dance 7
with 34
others 1
in 2719
vain 8
did 23
she 199
entreat 8
him 9
to 805
stand 42
up 194
with 34
somebody 2
else 2
and 51
offer 10
to 805
introduce 3
him 9
to 805
any 17
young 9
lady 18
in 2719
the 193
room 22
he 962
assured 4
her 181
that 11
as 509
to 805
dancing 2
he 962
was 93
perfectly 1
indifferent 2
to 805
it 67
that 11
his 43
chief 14
object 26
was 93
by 57
delicate 7
attentions 1
to 805
recommend 8
himself 1
to 805
her 181
and 51
that 11
he 962
should 7
therefore 1
make 17
a 6799
point 22
of 109
remaining 1
close 22
to 805
her 181
the 193
whole 26
evening 3
there 21
was 93
no 896
arguing 1
upon 1
such 2
a 6799
project 17
she 199
owed 1
her 181
greatest 1
relief 3
to 805
her 181
friend 14
miss 71
lucas 1
who 79
often 4
joined 1
them 9
and 51
good 28
engaged 1
mr 5
conversation 8
to 805
herself 1
she 199
was 93
at 272
least 3
free 93
from 2
the 193
offense 3
of 109
mr 5
darcy's 1

the 193
last 7

all 162
the 193
company 2
to 805
depart 19
and 51
by 57
a 6799
of 109
mrs 1
bennet 1
had 11
to 805
wait 19
for 484
their 2
carriage 5
a 6799
quarter 25
of 109
an 970
hour 10
after 48
everybody 2
else 2
was 93
gone 4
which 2
gave 4
them 9
time 45
to 805
see 70
how 27
heartily 1
they 5
were 5
wished 1
away 1
by 57
some 30
of 109
the 193
family 2
mrs 1
hurst 2
and 51
her 181
sister 9
scarcely 1
opened 1
their 2
mouths 1
except 10
to 805
complain 13
of 109
fatigue 5

were 5
evidently 1
impatient 2
to 805

repulsed 1
every 10
attempt 5
of 109
mrs 1

at 272
conversation 8
and 51
by 57
so 797
doing 3
threw 1
a 6799
languor 5
over 596
the 193
whole 26
party 3
which 2
was 93
very 1
little 6
relieved 1
by 57
the 193
long 49
speeches 1
of 109
mr 5
collins 1
who 79
was 93
complimenting 1
mr 5
and 51
his 43
sisters 1
on 86
the 193
elegance 2
of 109
their 2
entertainment 3

the 193
hospitality 2

politeness 2
which 2
had 11
marked 2

guests 1

said 1
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
mr 5

in 2719
equal 17
silence 7
was 93
enjoying 1
the 193
scene 5
mr 5
and 51
jane 8
were 5
standing 3
together 3
a 6799
little 6
detached 1
from 2
the 193
rest 110
and 51
talked 1
only 1
to 805
each 1
other 5
elizabeth 5
preserved 1
as 509
steady 3
a 6799
silence 7
as 509
either 1
mrs 1
hurst 2
or 333
miss 71
and 51
even 36
lydia 4
was 93
too 50
much 2
fatigued 1
to 805
utter 10
more 11
than 22
the 193
occasional 2
exclamation 3
of 109
lord 13
how 27
tired 6
i 4330
am 392
accompanied 1
by 57
a 6799
violent 2
yawn 8
when 6
at 272
length 14
they 5
arose 1
to 805
take 18
leave 14
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
most 3
pressingly 1
civil 15
in 2719
her 181
hope 16
of 109
seeing 2
the 193
whole 26
family 2
soon 3
at 272
and 51
addressed 1
herself 1
especially 1
to 805
mr 5
to 805
assure 6
him 9
how 27
happy 1
he 962
would 5
make 17
them 9
by 57
eating 1
a 6799
family 2
dinner 9
with 34
them 9
at 272
any 17
time 45
without 1
the 193
ceremony 2
of 109
a 6799
formal 21
invitation 6
was 93
all 162
grateful 4
pleasure 5
and 51
he 962
readily 1
engaged 1
for 484
taking 4
the 193
earliest 1
opportunity 2
of 109
waiting 2
on 86
her 181
after 48
his 43
return 14
from 2
london 5
whither 1
he 962
was 93
obliged 1
to 805
go 500
the 193
next 2
day 27
for 484
a 6799
short 62
time 45
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
perfectly 1
satisfied 1
and 51
the 193
house 87
under 288
the 193
delightful 2
persuasion 3
that 11
allowing 1
for 484
the 193
necessary 2
preparations 1
of 109
settlements 1
new 115
carriages 1
and 51
wedding 3
clothes 10
she 199
should 7
undoubtedly 1
see 70
her 181
daughter 4
settled 1
at 272
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
three 12
or 333
four 26
months 1
of 109
having 1
another 1
daughter 4
married 3
to 805
mr 5
collins 1
she 199
thought 11
with 34
equal 17
certainty 2
and 51
with 34
considerable 1
though 12
not 85
equal 17
pleasure 5
elizabeth 5
was 93
the 193
least 3
dear 15
to 805
her 181
of 109
all 162
her 181
children 1
and 51
though 12
the 193
man 342
and 51
the 193
match 25
were 5
quite 1
good 28
enough 2
for 484
her 181
the 193
worth 15
of 109
each 1
was 93
eclipsed 1
by 57
mr 5
and 51
chapter 3
the 193
next 2
day 27
opened 1
a 6799
new 115
scene 5
at 272
mr 5
collins 1
made 13
his 43
declaration 3
in 2719
form 68
having 1
resolved 1
to 805
do 814
it 67
without 1
loss 3
of 109
time 45
as 509
his 43
leave 14
of 109
absence 3
extended 1
only 1
to 805
the 193
following 3
saturday 3
and 51
having 1
no 896
feelings 1
of 109
diffidence 2
to 805
make 17
it 67
distressing 2
to 805
himself 1
even 36
at 272
the 193
moment 14
he 962
set 40
about 1
it 67
in 2719
a 6799
very 1
orderly 2
manner 8
with 34
all 162
the 193
observances 1
which 2
he 962
supposed 2
a 6799
regular 13
part 102
of 109
the 193
business 13
on 86
finding 4
mrs 1
bennet 1
elizabeth 5
and 51
one 19
of 109
the 193
younger 1
girls 1
together 3
soon 3
after 48
breakfast 5
he 962
addressed 1
the 193
mother 21
in 2719
these 4
words 5
may 49
i 4330
hope 16
madam 5
for 484
your 4
interest 6
with 34
your 4
fair 25
daughter 4
elizabeth 5
when 6
i 4330
solicit 16
for 484
the 193
of 109
a 6799
private 9
audience 3
with 34
her 181
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
this 6
morning 3
before 2
elizabeth 5
had 11
time 45
for 484
anything 3
but 82
a 6799
blush 8
of 109
surprise 4
mrs 1
bennet 1
answered 1
instantly 1
oh 17
dear 15
yes 16
certainly 1
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
lizzy 2
will 39
be 1200
very 1
happy 1
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
she 199
can 287
have 11
no 896
objection 5
come 36
kitty 2
i 4330
want 13
you 29
up 194
stairs 1
and 51
gathering 3
her 181
work 87
together 3
she 199
was 93
hastening 1
away 1
when 6
elizabeth 5
called 1
out 365
dear 15
madam 5
do 814
not 85
go 500
i 4330
beg 59
you 29
will 39
not 85
go 500
mr 5
collins 1
must 28
excuse 4
me 1041
he 962
can 287
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
say 7
to 805
me 1041
that 11
anybody 2
need 29
not 85
hear 76
i 4330
am 392
going 3
away 1
myself 1
no 896
no 896
nonsense 2
lizzy 2
i 4330
desire 6
you 29
to 805
stay 7
where 21
you 29
are 12
and 51
upon 1
elizabeth's 1
seeming 2
really 1
with 34
vexed 1
and 51
embarrassed 1
looks 1
about 1
to 805
escape 10
she 199
added 1
lizzy 2
i 4330
insist 9
upon 1
your 4
staying 1
and 51
hearing 3
mr 5
collins 1
elizabeth 5
would 5
not 85
oppose 3
such 2
an 970
injunction 3
and 51
a 6799
moment's 1
consideration 3
making 4
her 181
also 3
sensible 3
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
wisest 1
to 805
get 13
it 67
over 596
as 509
soon 3
and 51
as 509
quietly 1
as 509
possible 3
she 199
sat 92
down 90
again 2
and 51
tried 1
to 805
conceal 10
by 57
incessant 2
employment 3
the 193
feelings 1
which 2
were 5
divided 1
between 1
distress 7
and 51
diversion 4
mrs 1
bennet 1
and 51
kitty 2
walked 1
off 100
and 51
as 509
soon 3
as 509
they 5
were 5
gone 4
mr 5
collins 1
began 1
believe 6
me 1041
my 90
dear 15
miss 71
elizabeth 5
that 11
your 4
modesty 2
so 797
far 91
from 2
doing 3
you 29
any 17
disservice 3
rather 2
adds 1
to 805
your 4
other 5
perfections 1
you 29
would 5
have 11
been 1
less 19
amiable 1
in 2719
my 90
eyes 8
had 11
there 21
not 85
been 1
this 6
little 6
unwillingness 2
but 82
allow 9
me 1041
to 805
assure 6
you 29
that 11
i 4330
have 11
your 4
respected 1
mother's 1
permission 3
for 484
this 6
address 9
you 29
can 287
hardly 1
doubt 15
the 193
purport 6
of 109
my 90
discourse 4
however 1
your 4
natural 18
delicacy 2
may 49
lead 15
you 29
to 805
dissemble 6
my 90
attentions 1
have 11
been 1
too 50
marked 2
to 805
be 1200
mistaken 2
almost 1
as 509
soon 3
as 509
i 4330
entered 1
the 193
house 87
i 4330
singled 1
you 29
out 365
as 509
the 193
companion 10
of 109
my 90
future 3
life 44
but 82
before 2
i 4330
am 392
run 50
away 1
with 34
by 57
my 90
feelings 1
on 86
this 6
subject 11
perhaps 1
it 67
would 5
be 1200
advisable 1
for 484
me 1041
to 805
state 41
my 90
reasons 1
for 484
marrying 1
and 51
moreover 1
for 484
coming 3
into 26
with 34
the 193
design 16
of 109
selecting 1
a 6799
wife 6
as 509
i 4330
certainly 1
did 23
the 193
idea 21
of 109
mr 5
collins 1
with 34
all 162
his 43
solemn 21
composure 2
being 3
run 50
away 1
with 34
by 57
his 43
feelings 1
made 13
elizabeth 5
so 797
near 15
laughing 6
that 11
she 199
could 2
not 85
use 18
the 193
short 62
pause 4
he 962
allowed 1
in 2719
any 17
attempt 5
to 805
stop 36
him 9
further 8
and 51
he 962
continued 1
my 90
reasons 1
for 484
marrying 1
are 12
first 8
that 11
i 4330
think 8
it 67
a 6799
right 31
thing 15
for 484
every 10
clergyman 2
in 2719
easy 2
circumstances 1
like 22
myself 1
to 805
set 40
the 193
example 4
of 109
matrimony 2
in 2719
his 43
parish 6
secondly 1
that 11
i 4330
am 392
convinced 1
that 11
it 67
will 39
add 54
very 1
greatly 1
to 805
my 90
happiness 2
and 51
thirdly 1
which 2
perhaps 1
i 4330
ought 2
to 805
have 11
mentioned 1
earlier 1
that 11
it 67
is 124
the 193
particular 13
advice 2
and 51
recommendation 3
of 109
the 193
very 1
noble 13
lady 18
whom 3
i 4330
have 11
the 193
of 109
calling 3
patroness 3
twice 1
has 41
she 199
condescended 1
to 805
give 15
me 1041
her 181
opinion 4
unasked 1
too 50
on 86
this 6
subject 11
and 51
it 67
was 93
but 82
the 193
very 1
saturday 3
night 61
before 2
i 4330
left 19
between 1
our 3
pools 3
at 272
quadrille 3
while 4
mrs 1
was 93
arranging 1
miss 71
de 2452
footstool 3
that 11
she 199
said 1
collins 1
you 29
must 28
marry 2
a 6799
clergyman 2
like 22
you 29
must 28
marry 2
choose 5
properly 1
choose 5
a 6799
gentlewoman 2
for 484
my 90
sake 2
and 51
for 484
your 4
own 9
let 50
her 181
be 1200
an 970
active 6
useful 4
sort 14
of 109
person 33
not 85
brought 1
up 194
high 54
but 82
able 3
to 805
make 17
a 6799
small 14
income 5
go 500
a 6799
good 28
way 27
this 6
is 124
my 90
advice 2
find 10
such 2
a 6799
woman 21
as 509
soon 3
as 509
you 29
can 287
bring 6
her 181
to 805
and 51
i 4330
will 39
visit 14
her 181
allow 9
me 1041
by 57
the 193
way 27
to 805
observe 6
my 90
fair 25
cousin 3
that 11
i 4330
do 814
not 85
reckon 6
the 193
notice 8
and 51
kindness 3
of 109
lady 18
catherine 2
de 2452
as 509
among 1
the 193
least 3
of 109
the 193
advantages 1
in 2719
my 90
power 19
to 805
offer 10
you 29
will 39
find 10
her 181
manners 1
beyond 1
anything 3
i 4330
can 287
describe 6
and 51
your 4
wit 77
and 51
vivacity 2
i 4330
think 8
must 28
be 1200
acceptable 3
to 805
her 181
especially 1
when 6
tempered 1
with 34
the 193
silence 7
and 51
respect 18
which 2
her 181
rank 19
will 39
inevitably 1
excite 10
thus 1
much 2
for 484
my 90
general 22
intention 5
in 2719
of 109
matrimony 2
it 67
remains 1
to 805
be 1200
told 1
why 4
my 90
views 1
were 5
directed 1
towards 1
instead 1
of 109
my 90
own 9
where 21
i 4330
can 287
assure 6
you 29
there 21
are 12
many 2
amiable 1
young 9
women 5
but 82
the 193
fact 35
is 124
that 11
being 3
as 509
i 4330
am 392
to 805
inherit 11
this 6
estate 3
after 48
the 193
death 19
of 109
your 4
father 12
who 79
however 1
may 49
live 43
many 2
years 1
longer 1
i 4330
could 2
not 85
satisfy 3
myself 1
without 1
resolving 1
to 805
choose 5
a 6799
wife 6
from 2
among 1
his 43
daughters 1
that 11
the 193
loss 3
to 805
them 9
might 9
be 1200
as 509
little 6
as 509
possible 3
when 6
the 193
melancholy 2
event 18
takes 1
place 29
which 2
however 1
as 509
i 4330
have 11
already 1
said 1
may 49
not 85
be 1200
for 484
several 3
years 1
this 6
has 41
been 1
my 90
motive 4
my 90
fair 25
cousin 3
and 51
i 4330
flatter 10
myself 1
it 67
will 39
not 85
sink 13
me 1041
in 2719
your 4
esteem 5
and 51
now 10
nothing 5
remains 1
for 484
me 1041
but 82
to 805
assure 6
you 29
in 2719
the 193
most 3
animated 2
language 3
of 109
the 193
violence 2
of 109
my 90
affection 5
to 805
fortune 8
i 4330
am 392
perfectly 1
indifferent 2
and 51
shall 12
make 17
no 896
demand 5
of 109
that 11
nature 3
on 86
your 4
father 12
since 7
i 4330
am 392
well 24
aware 3
that 11
it 67
could 2
not 85
be 1200
complied 1
with 34
and 51
that 11
one 19
thousand 7
pounds 1
in 2719
the 193
four 26
per 551
cents 1
which 2
will 39
not 85
be 1200
yours 3
till 14
after 48
your 4
mother's 1
decease 5
is 124
all 162
that 11
you 29
may 49
ever 33
be 1200
entitled 1
to 805
on 86
that 11
head 140
therefore 1
i 4330
shall 12
be 1200
uniformly 1
silent 6
and 51
you 29
may 49
assure 6
yourself 1
that 11
no 896
ungenerous 1
reproach 8
shall 12
ever 33
pass 66
my 90
lips 8
when 6
we 444
are 12
married 3
it 67
was 93
absolutely 1
necessary 2
to 805
interrupt 11
him 9
now 10
you 29
are 12
too 50
hasty 1
sir 22
she 199
cried 1
you 29
forget 8
that 11
i 4330
have 11
made 13
no 896
answer 8
let 50
me 1041
do 814
it 67
without 1
further 8
loss 3
of 109
time 45
accept 16
my 90
thanks 4
for 484
the 193
compliment 6
you 29
are 12
paying 1
me 1041
i 4330
am 392
very 1
sensible 3
of 109
the 193
of 109
your 4
proposals 1
but 82
it 67
is 124
impossible 2
for 484
me 1041
to 805
do 814
otherwise 1
than 22
to 805
decline 7
them 9
i 4330
am 392
not 85
now 10
to 805
learn 9
replied 1
mr 5
collins 1
with 34
a 6799
formal 21
wave 23
of 109
the 193
hand 137
that 11
it 67
is 124
usual 3
with 34
young 9
ladies 1
to 805
reject 8
the 193
addresses 1
of 109
the 193
man 342
whom 3
they 5
secretly 1
mean 36
to 805
accept 16
when 6
he 962
first 8
applies 1
for 484
their 2
and 51
that 11
sometimes 1
the 193
refusal 3
is 124
repeated 2
a 6799
second 16
or 333
even 36
a 6799
third 4
time 45
i 4330
am 392
therefore 1
by 57
no 896
means 1
discouraged 1
by 57
what 14
you 29
have 11
just 24
said 1
and 51
shall 12
hope 16
to 805
lead 15
you 29
to 805
the 193
altar 6
ere 23
long 49
upon 1
my 90
word 26
sir 22
cried 1
elizabeth 5
your 4
hope 16
is 124
a 6799
rather 2
extraordinary 1
one 19
after 48
my 90
declaration 3
i 4330
do 814
assure 6
you 29
that 11
i 4330
am 392
not 85
one 19
of 109
those 1
young 9
ladies 1
if 8
such 2
young 9
ladies 1
there 21
are 12
who 79
are 12
so 797
daring 3
as 509
to 805
risk 11
their 2
happiness 2
on 86
the 193
chance 20
of 109
being 3
asked 1
a 6799
second 16
time 45
i 4330
am 392
perfectly 1
serious 4
in 2719
my 90
refusal 3
you 29
could 2
not 85
make 17
me 1041
happy 1
and 51
i 4330
am 392
convinced 1
that 11
i 4330
am 392
the 193
last 7
woman 21
in 2719
the 193
world 12
who 79
could 2
make 17
you 29
so 797
nay 6
were 5
your 4
friend 14
lady 18
catherine 2
to 805
know 12
me 1041
i 4330
am 392
persuaded 1
she 199
would 5
find 10
me 1041
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
ill 84
qualified 1
for 484
the 193
situation 3
were 5
it 67
certain 5
that 11
lady 18
catherine 2
would 5
think 8
so 797
said 1
mr 5
collins 1
very 1
gravely 1
but 82
i 4330
cannot 1
imagine 3
that 11
her 181
ladyship 3
would 5
at 272
all 162
disapprove 3
of 109
you 29
and 51
you 29
may 49
be 1200
certain 5
when 6
i 4330
have 11
the 193
of 109
seeing 2
her 181
again 2
i 4330
shall 12
speak 12
in 2719
the 193
very 1
highest 1
terms 1
of 109
your 4
modesty 2
economy 2
and 51
other 5
amiable 1
qualification 3
indeed 1
mr 5
collins 1
all 162
praise 7
of 109
me 1041
will 39
be 1200
unnecessary 1
you 29
must 28
give 15
me 1041
leave 14
to 805
judge 6
for 484
myself 1
and 51
pay 52
me 1041
the 193
compliment 6
of 109
believing 1
what 14
i 4330
say 7
i 4330
wish 13
you 29
very 1
happy 1
and 51
very 1
rich 19
and 51
by 57
refusing 1
your 4
hand 137
do 814
all 162
in 2719
my 90
power 19
to 805
prevent 13
your 4
being 3
otherwise 1
in 2719
making 4
me 1041
the 193
offer 10
you 29
must 28
have 11
satisfied 1
the 193
delicacy 2
of 109
your 4
feelings 1
with 34
regard 7
to 805
my 90
family 2
and 51
may 49
take 18
possession 3
of 109
estate 3
whenever 1
it 67
falls 1
without 1
any 17
self 11
reproach 8
this 6
matter 7
may 49
be 1200
considered 1
therefore 1
as 509
finally 1
settled 1
and 51
rising 3
as 509
she 199
thus 1
spoke 14
she 199
would 5
have 11
the 193
room 22
had 11
mr 5
collins 1
not 85
thus 1
addressed 1
her 181
when 6
i 4330
do 814
myself 1
the 193
of 109
speaking 2
to 805
you 29
next 2
on 86
the 193
subject 11
i 4330
shall 12
hope 16
to 805
receive 8
a 6799
more 11
answer 8
than 22
you 29
have 11
now 10
given 3
me 1041
though 12
i 4330
am 392
far 91
from 2
accusing 2
you 29
of 109
cruelty 2
at 272
present 20
because 1
i 4330
know 12
it 67
to 805
be 1200
the 193
established 1
custom 17
of 109
your 4
sex 45
to 805
reject 8
a 6799
man 342
on 86
the 193
first 8
application 3
and 51
perhaps 1
you 29
have 11
even 36
now 10
said 1
as 509
much 2
to 805
encourage 6
my 90
suit 21
as 509
would 5
be 1200
consistent 2
with 34
the 193
true 9
delicacy 2
of 109
the 193
female 5
character 16
really 1
mr 5
collins 1
cried 1
elizabeth 5
with 34
some 30
warmth 2
you 29
puzzle 9
me 1041
exceedingly 1
if 8
what 14
i 4330
have 11
hitherto 1
said 1
can 287
appear 7
to 805
you 29
in 2719
the 193
form 68
of 109
encouragement 3
i 4330
know 12
not 85
how 27
to 805
express 25
my 90
refusal 3
in 2719
such 2
a 6799
way 27
as 509
to 805
convince 3
you 29
of 109
its 2
being 3
one 19
you 29
must 28
give 15
me 1041
leave 14
to 805
flatter 10
myself 1
my 90
dear 15
cousin 3
that 11
your 4
refusal 3
of 109
my 90
addresses 1
is 124
merely 1
words 5
of 109
course 10
my 90
reasons 1
for 484
believing 1
it 67
are 12
briefly 1
these 4
it 67
does 5
not 85
appear 7
to 805
me 1041
that 11
my 90
hand 137
is 124
unworthy 1
of 109
your 4
acceptance 3
or 333
that 11
the 193
establishment 3
i 4330
can 287
offer 10
would 5
be 1200
any 17
other 5
than 22
highly 1
desirable 3
my 90
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
my 90
connections 1
with 34
the 193
family 2
of 109
de 2452
and 51
my 90
relationship 3
to 805
your 4
own 9
are 12
circumstances 1
highly 1
in 2719
my 90
and 51
you 29
should 7
take 18
it 67
into 26
further 8
consideration 3
that 11
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
your 4
manifold 5
attractions 1
it 67
is 124
by 57
no 896
means 1
certain 5
that 11
another 1
offer 10
of 109
marriage 6
may 49
ever 33
be 1200
made 13
you 29
your 4
portion 5
is 124
unhappily 1
so 797
small 14
that 11
it 67
will 39
in 2719
all 162
likelihood 3
undo 10
the 193
effects 1
of 109
your 4
loveliness 2
and 51
amiable 1
qualifications 1
as 509
i 4330
must 28
therefore 1
conclude 3
that 11
you 29
are 12
not 85
serious 4
in 2719
your 4
rejection 3
of 109
me 1041
i 4330
shall 12
choose 5
to 805
attribute 4
it 67
to 805
your 4
wish 13
of 109
increasing 2
my 90
love 29
by 57
suspense 3
according 2
to 805
the 193
usual 3
practice 4
of 109
elegant 2
females 1
i 4330
do 814
assure 6
you 29
sir 22
that 11
i 4330
have 11
no 896
pretensions 1
whatever 1
to 805
that 11
kind 31
of 109
elegance 2
which 2
consists 1
in 2719
tormenting 2
a 6799
respectable 1
man 342
i 4330
would 5
rather 2
be 1200
paid 1
the 193
compliment 6
of 109
being 3
believed 1
sincere 4
i 4330
thank 15
you 29
again 2
and 51
again 2
for 484
the 193
you 29
have 11
done 3
me 1041
in 2719
your 4
proposals 1
but 82
to 805
accept 16
them 9
is 124
absolutely 1
impossible 2
my 90
feelings 1
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
forbid 6
it 67
can 287
i 4330
speak 12
plainer 1
do 814
not 85
consider 13
me 1041
now 10
as 509
an 970
elegant 2
female 5
intending 1
to 805
plague 4
you 29
but 82
as 509
a 6799
rational 22
creature 3
speaking 2
the 193
truth 7
from 2
her 181
heart 57
you 29
are 12
uniformly 1
charming 2
cried 1
he 962
with 34
an 970
air 129
of 109
awkward 6
gallantry 2
and 51
i 4330
am 392
persuaded 1
that 11
when 6
sanctioned 1
by 57
the 193
express 25
authority 2
of 109
both 8
your 4
excellent 2
parents 1
my 90
proposals 1
will 39
not 85
fail 12
of 109
being 3
acceptable 3
to 805
such 2
perseverance 2
in 2719
self 11
deception 3
elizabeth 5
would 5
make 17
no 896
reply 3
and 51
immediately 1
and 51
in 2719
silence 7
withdrew 1
determined 2
if 8
he 962
persisted 1
in 2719
considering 1
her 181
repeated 2
refusals 1
as 509
flattering 2
encouragement 3
to 805
apply 2
to 805
her 181
father 12
whose 1
negative 7
might 9
be 1200
uttered 1
in 2719
such 2
a 6799
manner 8
as 509
to 805
be 1200
decisive 4
and 51
whose 1
at 272
least 3
could 2
not 85
be 1200
mistaken 2
for 484
the 193
affectation 3
and 51
coquetry 2
of 109
an 970
elegant 2
female 5
chapter 3
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
not 85
left 19
long 49
to 805
the 193
silent 6
contemplation 2
of 109
his 43
successful 2
love 29
for 484
mrs 1
bennet 1
having 1
dawdled 1
about 1
in 2719
the 193
vestibule 3
to 805
watch 35
for 484
the 193
end 92
of 109
the 193
conference 3
no 896
sooner 1
saw 24
elizabeth 5
open 21
the 193
door 41
and 51
with 34
quick 25
step 48
pass 66
her 181
towards 1
the 193
staircase 3
than 22
she 199
entered 1
the 193
breakfast 5
room 22
and 51
congratulated 1
both 8
him 9
and 51
herself 1
in 2719
warm 23
terms 1
on 86
the 193
happy 1
prospect 13
of 109
their 2
nearer 1
connection 3
mr 5
collins 1
received 1
and 51
returned 1
these 4
felicitations 1
with 34
equal 17
pleasure 5
and 51
then 5
proceeded 1
to 805
relate 8
the 193
particulars 1
of 109
their 2
interview 11
with 34
the 193
result 8
of 109
which 2
he 962
trusted 1
he 962
had 11
every 10
reason 13
to 805
be 1200
satisfied 1
since 7
the 193
refusal 3
which 2
his 43
cousin 3
had 11
steadfastly 1
given 3
him 9
would 5
naturally 1
flow 27
from 2
her 181
bashful 4
modesty 2
and 51
the 193
genuine 4
delicacy 2
of 109
her 181
character 16
this 6
information 3
however 1
startled 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
she 199
would 5
have 11
been 1
glad 30
to 805
be 1200
equally 1
satisfied 1
that 11
her 181
daughter 4
had 11
meant 3
to 805
encourage 6
him 9
by 57
protesting 1
against 1
his 43
proposals 1
but 82
she 199
dared 6
not 85
believe 6
it 67
and 51
could 2
not 85
help 23
saying 3
so 797
but 82
depend 17
upon 1
it 67
mr 5
collins 1
she 199
added 1
that 11
lizzy 2
shall 12
be 1200
brought 1
to 805
reason 13
i 4330
will 39
speak 12
to 805
her 181
about 1
it 67
directly 1
she 199
is 124
a 6799
very 1
headstrong 1
foolish 4
girl 14
and 51
does 5
not 85
know 12
her 181
own 9
interest 6
but 82
i 4330
will 39
make 17
her 181
know 12
it 67
pardon 10
me 1041
for 484
interrupting 1
you 29
madam 5
cried 1
mr 5
collins 1
but 82
if 8
she 199
is 124
really 1
headstrong 1
and 51
foolish 4
i 4330
know 12
not 85
whether 1
she 199
would 5
altogether 1
be 1200
a 6799
very 1
desirable 3
wife 6
to 805
a 6799
man 342
in 2719
my 90
situation 3
who 79
naturally 1
looks 1
for 484
happiness 2
in 2719
the 193
marriage 6
state 41
if 8
therefore 1
she 199
actually 1
persists 1
in 2719
rejecting 1
my 90
suit 21
perhaps 1
it 67
were 5
better 7
not 85
to 805
force 10
her 181
into 26
accepting 1
me 1041
because 1
if 8
liable 1
to 805
such 2
defects 1
of 109
temper 22
she 199
could 2
not 85
contribute 3
much 2
to 805
my 90
felicity 2
sir 22
you 29
quite 1
misunderstand 5
me 1041
said 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
alarmed 1
lizzy 2
is 124
only 1
headstrong 1
in 2719
such 2
matters 1
as 509
these 4
in 2719
everything 2
else 2
she 199
is 124
as 509
good 28
a 6799
girl 14
as 509
ever 33
lived 1
i 4330
will 39
go 500
directly 1
to 805
mr 5
bennet 1
and 51
we 444
shall 12
very 1
soon 3
settle 10
it 67
with 34
her 181
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
she 199
would 5
not 85
give 15
him 9
time 45
to 805
reply 3
but 82
hurrying 1
instantly 1
to 805
her 181
husband 10
called 1
out 365
as 509
she 199
entered 1
the 193
library 2
oh 17
mr 5
bennet 1
you 29
are 12
wanted 1
immediately 1
we 444
are 12
all 162
in 2719
an 970
uproar 5
you 29
must 28
come 36
and 51
make 17
lizzy 2
marry 2
mr 5
collins 1
for 484
she 199
vows 1
she 199
will 39
not 85
have 11
him 9
and 51
if 8
you 29
do 814
not 85
make 17
haste 8
he 962
will 39
change 21
his 43
mind 25
and 51
not 85

raised 1
his 43
eyes 8

entered 1
and 51
fixed 2
them 9
on 86
her 181
face 19
with 34
a 6799
calm 10
unconcern 4
which 2
was 93

in 2719

least 3
altered 1
by 57
her 181
communication 3

pleasure 5
of 109

to 805

what 14

of 109
your 4
parents 1
your 4
mother 21

not 85
but 82
smile 7
at 272
such 2
a 6799
conclusion 3
of 109
such 2
a 6799
beginning 3
but 82
mrs 1
bennet 1
who 79
had 11
persuaded 1
herself 1
that 11
her 181
husband 10
regarded 1
the 193
affair 3
as 509
she 199
wished 1
was 93
excessively 1
disappointed 1
what 14
do 814
you 29
mean 36
mr 5
bennet 1
in 2719
talking 1
this 6
way 27
you 29
promised 1
me 1041
to 805
insist 9
upon 1
her 181
marrying 1
him 9
my 90
dear 15
replied 1
her 181
husband 10
i 4330
have 11
two 14
small 14
to 805
request 6
first 8
that 11
you 29
will 39
allow 9
me 1041
the 193
free 93
use 18
of 109
my 90
understanding 4
on 86
the 193
present 20
occasion 7
and 51
secondly 1
of 109
my 90
room 22
i 4330
shall 12
be 1200
glad 30
to 805
have 11
the 193
library 2
to 805
myself 1
as 509
soon 3
as 509
may 49
be 1200
not 85
yet 4
however 1
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
her 181
disappointment 3
in 2719
her 181
husband 10
did 23
mrs 1
bennet 1
give 15
up 194
the 193
point 22
she 199
talked 1
to 805
elizabeth 5
again 2
and 51
again 2
coaxed 1
and 51
threatened 1
her 181
by 57
turns 4
she 199
to 805
secure 6
jane 8
in 2719
her 181
interest 6
but 82
jane 8
with 34
all 162
possible 3
mildness 2
declined 1
interfering 1
and 51
elizabeth 5
sometimes 1
with 34
real 47
earnestness 2
and 51
sometimes 1
with 34
playful 4
gaiety 2
replied 1
to 805
her 181
attacks 1
though 12
her 181
manner 8
varied 1
however 1
her 181
determination 3
never 3
did 23
mr 5
collins 1
meanwhile 2
was 93
meditating 1
in 2719
solitude 2
on 86
what 14
had 11
passed 1
he 962
thought 11
too 50
well 24
of 109
himself 1
to 805
comprehend 4
on 86
what 14
motives 1
his 43
cousin 3
could 2
refuse 4
him 9
and 51
though 12
his 43
pride 6
was 93
hurt 12
he 962
suffered 1
in 2719
no 896
other 5
way 27
his 43
regard 7
for 484
her 181
was 93
quite 1
imaginary 1
and 51
the 193
possibility 2
of 109
her 181
deserving 1
her 181
mother's 1
reproach 8
prevented 1
his 43
feeling 4
any 17
regret 9
while 4
the 193
family 2
were 5
in 2719
this 6
confusion 3
charlotte 4
lucas 1
came 36
to 805
spend 11
the 193
day 27
with 34
them 9
she 199
was 93
met 180
in 2719
the 193
vestibule 3
by 57
lydia 4
who 79
flying 2
to 805
her 181
cried 1
in 2719
a 6799
half 23
whisper 8
i 4330
am 392
glad 30
you 29
are 12
come 36
for 484
there 21
is 124
such 2
fun 88
here 31
what 14
do 814
you 29
think 8
has 41
happened 1
this 6
morning 3
mr 5
collins 1
has 41
made 13
an 970
offer 10
to 805
lizzy 2
and 51
she 199
will 39
not 85
have 11
him 9
charlotte 4
hardly 1
had 11
time 45
to 805
answer 8
before 2
they 5
were 5
joined 1
by 57
kitty 2
who 79
came 36
to 805
tell 16
the 193
same 5
news 71
and 51
no 896
sooner 1
had 11
they 5
entered 1
the 193
breakfast 5
room 22
where 21
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
alone 1
than 22
she 199
likewise 1
began 1
on 86
the 193
subject 11
calling 3
on 86
miss 71
lucas 1
for 484
her 181
compassion 4
and 51
entreating 2
her 181
to 805
persuade 6
her 181
friend 14
lizzy 2
to 805
comply 2
with 34
the 193
wishes 1
of 109
all 162
her 181
family 2
pray 9
do 814
my 90
dear 15
miss 71
lucas 1
she 199
added 1
in 2719
a 6799
melancholy 2
tone 12
for 484
nobody 2
is 124
on 86
my 90
side 74
nobody 2
takes 1
part 102
with 34
me 1041
i 4330
am 392
cruelly 1
used 1
nobody 2
feels 1
for 484
my 90
poor 11
nerves 1
charlotte's 1
reply 3
was 93
spared 1
by 57
the 193
entrance 6
of 109
jane 8
and 51
elizabeth 5
aye 4
there 21
she 199
comes 4
continued 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
looking 1
as 509
unconcerned 2
as 509
may 49
be 1200
and 51
caring 2
no 896
more 11
for 484
us 70
than 22
if 8
we 444
were 5
at 272
york 8
provided 1
she 199
can 287
have 11
her 181
own 9
way 27
but 82
i 4330
tell 16
you 29
miss 71
lizzy 2
if 8
you 29
take 18
it 67
into 26
your 4
head 140
to 805
go 500
on 86
refusing 1
every 10
offer 10
of 109
marriage 6
in 2719
this 6
way 27
you 29
will 39
never 3
get 13
a 6799
husband 10
at 272
all 162
and 51
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
who 79
is 124
to 805
maintain 8
you 29
when 6
your 4
father 12
is 124
dead 39
i 4330
shall 12
not 85
be 1200
able 3
to 805
keep 11
you 29
and 51
so 797
i 4330
warn 8
you 29
i 4330
have 11
done 3
with 34
you 29
from 2
this 6
very 1
day 27
i 4330
told 1
you 29
in 2719
the 193
library 2
you 29
know 12
that 11
i 4330
should 7
never 3
speak 12
to 805
you 29
again 2
and 51
you 29
will 39
find 10
me 1041
as 509
good 28
as 509
my 90
word 26
i 4330
have 11
no 896
pleasure 5
in 2719
talking 1
to 805
children 1
not 85
that 11
i 4330
have 11
much 2
pleasure 5
indeed 1
in 2719
talking 1
to 805
anybody 2
people 4
who 79
suffer 11
as 509
i 4330
do 814
from 2
nervous 4
complaints 1
can 287
have 11
no 896
great 12
inclination 3
for 484
talking 1
nobody 2
can 287
tell 16
what 14
i 4330
suffer 11
but 82
it 67
is 124
always 1
so 797
those 1
who 79
do 814
not 85
complain 13
are 12
never 3
pitied 1
her 181
daughters 1
listened 1
in 2719
silence 7
to 805
this 6
effusion 3
sensible 3
that 11
any 17
attempt 5
to 805
reason 13
with 34
her 181
or 333
soothe 6
her 181
would 5
only 1
increase 4
the 193
irritation 3
she 199
talked 1
on 86
therefore 1
without 1
interruption 3
from 2
any 17
of 109
them 9
till 14
they 5
were 5
joined 1
by 57
mr 5
collins 1
who 79
entered 1
the 193
room 22
with 34
an 970
air 129
more 11
stately 1
than 22
usual 3
and 51
on 86
perceiving 1
whom 3
she 199
said 1
to 805
the 193
girls 1
now 10
i 4330
do 814
insist 9
upon 1
it 67
that 11
you 29
all 162
of 109
you 29
hold 22
your 4
tongues 1
and 51
let 50
me 1041
and 51
mr 5
collins 1
have 11
a 6799
little 6
conversation 8
together 3
elizabeth 5
passed 1
quietly 1
out 365
of 109
the 193
room 22
jane 8
and 51
kitty 2
followed 1
but 82
lydia 4
stood 1
her 181
ground 36
determined 2
to 805
hear 76
all 162
she 199
could 2
and 51
charlotte 4
detained 1
first 8
by 57
the 193
civility 2
of 109
mr 5
collins 1
whose 1
inquiries 1
after 48
herself 1
and 51
all 162
her 181
family 2
were 5
very 1
minute 12
and 51
then 5
by 57
a 6799
little 6
curiosity 2
satisfied 1
herself 1
with 34
walking 2
to 805
the 193
window 12
and 51
pretending 1
not 85
to 805
hear 76
in 2719
a 6799
doleful 4
voice 8
mrs 1
bennet 1
began 1
the 193
projected 1
conversation 8
oh 17
mr 5
collins 1
my 90
dear 15
madam 5
replied 1
he 962
let 50
us 70
be 1200
for 484
ever 33
silent 6
on 86
this 6
point 22
far 91
be 1200
it 67
from 2
me 1041
he 962
presently 1
continued 1
in 2719
a 6799
voice 8
that 11
marked 2
his 43
displeasure 2
to 805
resent 11
the 193
of 109
your 4
daughter 4
resignation 3
to 805
inevitable 2
evils 1
is 124
the 193
duty 2
of 109
us 70
all 162
the 193
peculiar 5
duty 2
of 109
a 6799
young 9
man 342
who 79
has 41
been 1
so 797
fortunate 2
as 509
i 4330
have 11
been 1
in 2719
early 1
preferment 2
and 51
i 4330
trust 26
i 4330
am 392
resigned 2
perhaps 1
not 85
the 193
less 19
so 797
from 2
feeling 4
a 6799
doubt 15
of 109
my 90
positive 6
happiness 2
had 11
my 90
fair 25
cousin 3
me 1041
with 34
her 181
hand 137
for 484
i 4330
have 11
often 4
observed 1
that 11
resignation 3
is 124
never 3
so 797
perfect 24
as 509
when 6
the 193
blessing 3
denied 1
begins 1
to 805
lose 5
somewhat 2
of 109
its 2
value 8
in 2719
our 3
estimation 3
you 29
will 39
not 85
i 4330
hope 16
consider 13
me 1041
as 509
showing 3
any 17
disrespect 7
to 805
your 4
family 2
my 90
dear 15
madam 5
by 57
thus 1
withdrawing 1
my 90
pretensions 1
to 805
your 4
daughter's 1
without 1
having 1
paid 1
yourself 1
and 51
mr 5
bennet 1
the 193
compliment 6
of 109
requesting 1
you 29
to 805
interpose 3
your 4
authority 2
in 2719
my 90
behalf 2
my 90
conduct 21
may 49
i 4330
fear 14
be 1200
objectionable 1
in 2719
having 1
accepted 1
my 90
from 2
your 4
daughter's 1
lips 8
instead 1
of 109
your 4
own 9
but 82
we 444
are 12
all 162
liable 1
to 805
error 3
i 4330
have 11
certainly 1
meant 3
well 24
through 4
the 193
whole 26
affair 3
my 90
object 26
has 41
been 1
to 805
secure 6
an 970
amiable 1
companion 10
for 484
myself 1
with 34
due 21
consideration 3
for 484
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
all 162
your 4
family 2
and 51
if 8
my 90
manner 8
has 41
been 1
at 272
all 162
reprehensible 1
i 4330
here 31
beg 59
leave 14
to 805
chapter 3
the 193
discussion 3
of 109
mr 5
offer 10
was 93
now 10
nearly 1
at 272
an 970
end 92
and 51
elizabeth 5
had 11
only 1
to 805
suffer 11
from 2
the 193
uncomfortable 1
feelings 1
necessarily 1
attending 1
it 67
and 51
occasionally 1
from 2
some 30
peevish 4
allusions 1
of 109
her 181
mother 21
as 509
for 484
the 193
gentleman 3
himself 1
his 43
feelings 1
were 5
chiefly 1
expressed 1
not 85
by 57
embarrassment 3
or 333
dejection 2
or 333
by 57
trying 2
to 805
avoid 8
her 181
but 82
by 57
stiffness 2
of 109
manner 8
and 51
resentful 4
silence 7
he 962
scarcely 1
ever 33
spoke 14
to 805
her 181
and 51
the 193
assiduous 4
attentions 1
which 2
he 962
had 11
been 1
so 797
sensible 3
of 109
himself 1
were 5
transferred 1
for 484
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
day 27
to 805
miss 71
lucas 1
whose 1
civility 2
in 2719
listening 1
to 805
him 9
was 93
a 6799
seasonable 1
relief 3
to 805
them 9
all 162
and 51
especially 1
to 805
her 181
friend 14
the 193
morrow 3
produced 1
no 896
abatement 2
of 109
mrs 1
ill 84
or 333
ill 84
health 12
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
also 3
in 2719
the 193
same 5
state 41
of 109
angry 1
pride 6
elizabeth 5
had 11
hoped 1
that 11
his 43
resentment 3
might 9
shorten 6
his 43
visit 14
but 82
his 43
plan 61
did 23
not 85
appear 7
in 2719
the 193
least 3
affected 2
by 57
it 67
he 962
was 93
always 1
to 805
have 11
gone 4
on 86
saturday 3
and 51
to 805
saturday 3
he 962
meant 3
to 805
stay 7
after 48
breakfast 5
the 193
girls 1
walked 1
to 805
to 805
inquire 6
if 8
mr 5
were 5
returned 1
and 51
to 805
lament 10
over 596
his 43
absence 3
from 2
the 193
ball 77
he 962
joined 1
them 9
on 86
their 2
entering 1
the 193
town 27
and 51
attended 1
them 9
to 805
their 2
aunt's 1
where 21
his 43
regret 9
and 51
vexation 3
and 51
the 193
concern 6
of 109
everybody 2
was 93
well 24
talked 1
over 596
to 805
elizabeth 5
however 1
he 962
voluntarily 1
acknowledged 1
that 11
the 193
necessity 2
of 109
his 43
absence 3
had 11
been 1
self 11
imposed 1
i 4330
found 18
said 1
he 962
as 509
the 193
time 45
drew 2
near 15
that 11
i 4330
had 11
better 7
not 85
meet 9
mr 5
darcy 2
that 11
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
the 193
same 5
room 22
the 193
same 5
party 3
with 34
him 9
for 484
so 797
many 2
hours 1
together 3
might 9
be 1200
more 11
than 22
i 4330
could 2
bear 30
and 51
that 11
scenes 1
might 9
arise 3
unpleasant 4
to 805
more 11
than 22
myself 1
she 199
highly 1
approved 1
his 43
forbearance 2
and 51
they 5
had 11
leisure 8
for 484
a 6799
full 16
discussion 3
of 109
it 67
and 51
for 484
all 162
the 193
commendation 3
which 2
they 5
civilly 1
bestowed 1
on 86
each 1
other 5
as 509
and 51
another 1
officer 3
walked 1
back 182
with 34
them 9
to 805
and 51
during 1
the 193
walk 25
he 962
particularly 1
attended 1
to 805
her 181
his 43
accompanying 1
them 9
was 93
a 6799
double 14
advantage 6
she 199
felt 5
all 162
the 193
compliment 6
it 67
offered 1
to 805
herself 1
and 51
it 67
was 93
most 3
acceptable 3
as 509
an 970
occasion 7
of 109
introducing 1
him 9
to 805
her 181
father 12
and 51
mother 21
soon 3
after 48
their 2
return 14
a 6799
letter 20
was 93
delivered 1
to 805
miss 71
bennet 1
it 67
came 36
from 2
the 193
envelope 7
contained 1
a 6799
sheet 8
of 109
elegant 2
little 6
hot 56
pressed 1
paper 35
well 24
covered 1
with 34
a 6799
lady's 1
fair 25
flowing 1
hand 137
and 51
elizabeth 5
saw 24
her 181
sister's 1
countenance 4
change 21
as 509
she 199
read 49
it 67
and 51
saw 24
her 181
dwelling 3
intently 1
on 86
some 30
particular 13
passages 1
jane 8
recollected 1
herself 1
soon 3
and 51
putting 1
the 193
letter 20
away 1
tried 1
to 805
join 16
with 34
her 181
usual 3
cheerfulness 2
in 2719
the 193
general 22
conversation 8
but 82
elizabeth 5
felt 5
an 970
anxiety 2
on 86
the 193
subject 11
which 2
drew 2
off 100
her 181
attention 3
even 36
from 2
and 51
no 896
sooner 1
had 11
he 962
and 51
his 43
companion 10
taken 1
leave 14
than 22
a 6799
glance 4
from 2
jane 8
invited 1
her 181
to 805
follow 11
her 181
up 194
stairs 1
when 6
they 5
had 11
gained 1
their 2
own 9
room 22
jane 8
taking 4
out 365
the 193
letter 20
said 1
this 6
is 124
from 2
caroline 1
what 14
it 67
contains 1
has 41
surprised 1
me 1041
a 6799
good 28
deal 13
the 193
whole 26
party 3
have 11
left 19
by 57
this 6
time 45
and 51
are 12
on 86
their 2
way 27
to 805
town 27
and 51
without 1
any 17
intention 5
of 109
coming 3
back 182
again 2
you 29
shall 12
hear 76
what 14
she 199
says 1
she 199
then 5
read 49
the 193
first 8
sentence 4
aloud 1
which 2
comprised 1
the 193
information 3
of 109
their 2
having 1
just 24
resolved 1
to 805
follow 11
their 2
brother 9
to 805
town 27
directly 1
and 51
of 109
their 2
meaning 11
to 805
dine 9
in 2719
street 15
where 21
mr 5
hurst 2
had 11
a 6799
house 87
the 193
next 2
was 93
in 2719
these 4
words 5
i 4330
do 814
not 85
pretend 7
to 805
regret 9
anything 3
i 4330
shall 12
leave 14
in 2719
except 10
your 4
society 2
my 90
dearest 2
friend 14
but 82
we 444
will 39
hope 16
at 272
some 30
future 3
period 16
to 805
enjoy 9
many 2
returns 1
of 109
that 11
delightful 2
intercourse 2
we 444
have 11
known 1
and 51
in 2719
the 193
meanwhile 2
may 49
lessen 4
the 193
pain 42
of 109
separation 3
by 57
a 6799
very 1
frequent 9
and 51
most 3
unreserved 2
correspondence 3
i 4330
depend 17
on 86
you 29
for 484
that 11
to 805
these 4
expressions 1
elizabeth 5
listened 1
with 34
all 162
the 193
insensibility 2
of 109
distrust 7
and 51
though 12
the 193
suddenness 2
of 109
their 2
removal 3
surprised 1
her 181
she 199
saw 24
nothing 5
in 2719
it 67
really 1
to 805
lament 10
it 67
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1200
supposed 2
that 11
their 2
absence 3
from 2
would 5
prevent 13
mr 5
being 3
there 21
and 51
as 509
to 805
the 193
loss 3
of 109
their 2
society 2
she 199
was 93
persuaded 1
that 11
jane 8
must 28
cease 11
to 805
regard 7
it 67
in 2719
the 193
enjoyment 3
of 109
his 43
it 67
is 124
unlucky 1
said 1
she 199
after 48
a 6799
short 62
pause 4
that 11
you 29
should 7
not 85
be 1200
able 3
to 805
see 70
your 4
friends 4
before 2
they 5
leave 14
the 193
country 12
but 82
may 49
we 444
not 85
hope 16
that 11
the 193
period 16
of 109
future 3
happiness 2
to 805
which 2
miss 71
looks 1
forward 12
may 49
arrive 3
earlier 1
than 22
she 199
is 124
aware 3
and 51
that 11
the 193
delightful 2
intercourse 2
you 29
have 11
known 1
as 509
friends 4
will 39
be 1200
renewed 1
with 34
yet 4
greater 1
satisfaction 3
as 509
sisters 1
mr 5
will 39
not 85
be 1200
detained 1
in 2719
london 5
by 57
them 9
caroline 1
decidedly 1
says 1
that 11
none 32
of 109
the 193
party 3
will 39
return 14
into 26
this 6
winter 13
i 4330
will 39
read 49
it 67
to 805
you 29
when 6
my 90
brother 9
left 19
us 70
yesterday 3
he 962
imagined 1
that 11
the 193
business 13
which 2
took 1
him 9
to 805
london 5
might 9
be 1200
concluded 1
in 2719
three 12
or 333
four 26
days 1
but 82
as 509
we 444
are 12
certain 5
it 67
cannot 1
be 1200
so 797
and 51
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
convinced 1
that 11
when 6
charles 5
gets 1
to 805
town 27
he 962
will 39
be 1200
in 2719
no 896
hurry 3
to 805
leave 14
it 67
again 2
we 444
have 11
determined 2
on 86
following 3
him 9
thither 1
that 11
he 962
may 49
not 85
be 1200
obliged 1
to 805
spend 11
his 43
vacant 2
hours 1
in 2719
a 6799
comfortless 1
hotel 6
many 2
of 109
my 90
acquaintances 3
are 12
already 1
there 21
for 484
the 193
winter 13
i 4330
wish 13
that 11
i 4330
could 2
hear 76
that 11
you 29
my 90
dearest 2
friend 14
had 11
any 17
intention 5
of 109
making 4
one 19
of 109
the 193
crowd 5
but 82
of 109
that 11
i 4330
despair 6
i 4330
sincerely 1
hope 16
your 4
christmas 9
in 2719
may 49
abound 4
in 2719
the 193
which 2
that 11
season 12
generally 1
brings 1
and 51
that 11
your 4
will 39
be 1200
so 797
numerous 2
as 509
to 805
prevent 13
your 4
feeling 4
the 193
loss 3
of 109
the 193
three 12
of 109
whom 3
we 444
shall 12
deprive 3
you 29
it 67
is 124
evident 2
by 57
this 6
added 1
jane 8
that 11
he 962
comes 4
back 182
no 896
more 11
this 6
winter 13
it 67
is 124
only 1
evident 2
that 11
miss 71
does 5
not 85
mean 36
that 11
he 962
should 7
why 4
will 39
you 29
think 8
so 797
it 67
must 28
be 1200
his 43
own 9
doing 3
he 962
is 124
his 43
own 9
master 28
but 82
you 29
do 814
not 85
know 12
all 162
i 4330
will 39
read 49
you 29
the 193
passage 6
which 2
particularly 1
hurts 1
me 1041
i 4330
will 39
have 11
no 896
reserves 1
from 2
you 29
mr 5
darcy 2
is 124
impatient 2
to 805
see 70
his 43
sister 9
and 51
to 805
confess 14
the 193
truth 7
we 444
are 12
scarcely 1
less 19
eager 6
to 805
meet 9
her 181
again 2
i 4330
really 1
do 814
not 85
think 8
darcy 2
has 41
her 181
equal 17
for 484
beauty 2
elegance 2
and 51
accomplishments 1
and 51
the 193
affection 5
she 199
inspires 1
in 2719
louisa 2
and 51
myself 1
is 124
heightened 1
into 26
something 3
still 13
more 11
interesting 2
from 2
the 193
hope 16
we 444
dare 15
entertain 12
of 109
her 181
being 3
hereafter 3
our 3
sister 9
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
whether 1
i 4330
ever 33
before 2
mentioned 1
to 805
you 29
my 90
feelings 1
on 86
this 6
subject 11
but 82
i 4330
will 39
not 85
leave 14
the 193
country 12
without 1
confiding 2
them 9
and 51
i 4330
trust 26
you 29
will 39
not 85
esteem 5
them 9
unreasonable 3
my 90
brother 9
admires 1
her 181
greatly 1
already 1
he 962
will 39
have 11
frequent 9
opportunity 2
now 10
of 109
seeing 2
her 181
on 86
the 193
most 3
intimate 5
footing 3
her 181
relations 4
all 162
wish 13
the 193
connection 3
as 509
much 2
as 509
his 43
own 9
and 51
a 6799
sister's 1
partiality 2
is 124
not 85
misleading 2
me 1041
i 4330
think 8
when 6
i 4330
call 57
charles 5
most 3
capable 1
of 109
engaging 2
any 17
woman's 1
heart 57
with 34
all 162
these 4
circumstances 1
to 805
an 970
attachment 3
and 51
nothing 5
to 805
prevent 13
it 67
am 392
i 4330
wrong 24
my 90
dearest 2
jane 8
in 2719
indulging 1
the 193
hope 16
of 109
an 970
event 18
which 2
will 39
secure 6
the 193
happiness 2
of 109
so 797
many 2
what 14
do 814
you 29
think 8
of 109
this 6
sentence 4
my 90
dear 15
lizzy 2
said 1
jane 8
as 509
she 199
finished 1
it 67
is 124
it 67
not 85
clear 23
enough 2
does 5
it 67
not 85
expressly 1
declare 6
that 11
caroline 1
neither 1
expects 1
nor 102
wishes 1
me 1041
to 805
be 1200
her 181
sister 9
that 11
she 199
is 124
perfectly 1
convinced 1
of 109
her 181
brother's 1
indifference 2
and 51
that 11
if 8
she 199
suspects 1
the 193
nature 3
of 109
my 90
feelings 1
for 484
him 9
she 199
means 1
most 3
kindly 1
to 805
put 47
me 1041
on 86
my 90
guard 26
can 287
there 21
be 1200
any 17
other 5
opinion 4
on 86
the 193
subject 11
yes 16
there 21
can 287
for 484
mine 26
is 124
totally 1
different 11
will 39
you 29
hear 76
it 67
most 3
willingly 1
you 29
shall 12
have 11
it 67
in 2719
a 6799
few 6
words 5
miss 71
sees 6
that 11
her 181
brother 9
is 124
in 2719
love 29
with 34
you 29
and 51
wants 1
him 9
to 805
marry 2
miss 71
darcy 2
she 199
follows 1
him 9
to 805
town 27
in 2719
hope 16
of 109
keeping 2
him 9
there 21
and 51
tries 2
to 805
persuade 6
you 29
that 11
he 962
does 5
not 85
care 47
about 1
you 29
jane 8
shook 1
her 181
head 140
indeed 1
jane 8
you 29
ought 2
to 805
believe 6
me 1041
no 896
one 19
who 79
has 41
ever 33
seen 1
you 29
together 3
can 287
doubt 15
his 43
affection 5
miss 71
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
cannot 1
she 199
is 124
not 85
such 2
a 6799
simpleton 3
could 2
she 199
have 11
seen 1
half 23
as 509
much 2
love 29
in 2719
mr 5
darcy 2
for 484
herself 1
she 199
would 5
have 11
ordered 1
her 181
wedding 3
clothes 10
but 82
the 193
case 25
is 124
this 6
we 444
are 12
not 85
rich 19
enough 2
or 333
grand 74
enough 2
for 484
them 9
and 51
she 199
is 124
the 193
more 11
anxious 4
to 805
get 13
miss 71
darcy 2
for 484
her 181
brother 9
from 2
the 193
notion 5
that 11
when 6
there 21
has 41
been 1
one 19
intermarriage 3
she 199
may 49
have 11
less 19
trouble 18
in 2719
achieving 1
a 6799
second 16
in 2719
which 2
there 21
is 124
certainly 1
some 30
ingenuity 2
and 51
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
it 67
would 5
succeed 4
if 8
miss 71
de 2452
were 5
out 365
of 109
the 193
way 27
but 82
my 90
dearest 2
jane 8
you 29
cannot 1
seriously 1
imagine 3
that 11
because 1
miss 71
tells 1
you 29
her 181
brother 9
greatly 1
admires 1
miss 71
darcy 2
he 962
is 124
in 2719
the 193
smallest 1
degree 3
less 19
sensible 3
of 109
your 4
merit 13
than 22
when 6
he 962
took 1
leave 14
of 109
you 29
on 86
tuesday 3
or 333
that 11
it 67
will 39
be 1200
in 2719
her 181
power 19
to 805
persuade 6
him 9
that 11
instead 1
of 109
being 3
in 2719
love 29
with 34
you 29
he 962
is 124
very 1
much 2
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 181
friend 14
if 8
we 444
thought 11
alike 1
of 109
miss 71
replied 1
jane 8
your 4
representation 4
of 109
all 162
this 6
might 9
make 17
me 1041
quite 1
easy 2
but 82
i 4330
know 12
the 193
foundation 3
is 124
unjust 5
caroline 1
is 124
incapable 1
of 109
deceiving 2
anyone 2
and 51
all 162
that 11
i 4330
can 287
hope 16
in 2719
this 6
case 25
is 124
that 11
she 199
is 124
deceiving 2
herself 1
that 11
is 124
right 31
you 29
could 2
not 85
have 11
started 1
a 6799
more 11
happy 1
idea 21
since 7
you 29
will 39
not 85
take 18
comfort 14
in 2719
mine 26
believe 6
her 181
to 805
be 1200
deceived 1
by 57
all 162
means 1
you 29
have 11
now 10
done 3
your 4
duty 2
by 57
her 181
and 51
must 28
fret 14
no 896
longer 1
but 82
my 90
dear 15
sister 9
can 287
i 4330
be 1200
happy 1
even 36
supposing 1
the 193
best 37
in 2719
accepting 1
a 6799
man 342
whose 1
sisters 1
and 51
friends 4
are 12
all 162
wishing 1
him 9
to 805
marry 2
elsewhere 1
you 29
must 28
decide 6
for 484
yourself 1
said 1
elizabeth 5
and 51
if 8
upon 1
mature 6
deliberation 3
you 29
find 10
that 11
the 193
misery 2
of 109
disobliging 1
his 43
two 14
sisters 1
is 124
more 11
than 22
equivalent 4
to 805
the 193
happiness 2
of 109
being 3
his 43
wife 6
i 4330
advise 9
you 29
by 57
all 162
means 1
to 805
refuse 4
him 9
how 27
can 287
you 29
talk 18
so 797
said 1
jane 8
faintly 1
smiling 2
you 29
must 28
know 12
that 11
though 12
i 4330
should 7
be 1200
exceedingly 1
grieved 1
at 272
their 2
disapprobation 2
i 4330
could 2
not 85
hesitate 3
i 4330
did 23
not 85
think 8
you 29
would 5
and 51
that 11
being 3
the 193
case 25
i 4330
cannot 1
consider 13
your 4
situation 3
with 34
much 2
compassion 4
but 82
if 8
he 962
returns 1
no 896
more 11
this 6
winter 13
my 90
choice 5
will 39
never 3
be 1200
required 1
a 6799
thousand 7
things 1
may 49
arise 3
in 2719
six 24
months 1
the 193
idea 21
of 109
his 43
returning 1
no 896
more 11
elizabeth 5
treated 1
with 34
the 193
utmost 2
contempt 8
it 67
appeared 1
to 805
her 181
merely 1
the 193
suggestion 3
of 109
interested 1
wishes 1
and 51
she 199
could 2
not 85
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
suppose 4
that 11
those 1
wishes 1
however 1
openly 1
or 333
artfully 1
spoken 1
could 2
influence 4
a 6799
young 9
man 342
so 797
totally 1
independent 4
of 109
everyone 2
she 199
represented 1
to 805
her 181
sister 9
as 509
forcibly 1
as 509
possible 3
what 14
she 199
felt 5
on 86
the 193
subject 11
and 51
had 11
soon 3
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
seeing 2
its 2
happy 1
effect 15
temper 22
was 93
not 85
and 51
she 199
was 93
gradually 1
led 11
to 805
hope 16
though 12
the 193
diffidence 2
of 109
affection 5
sometimes 1
overcame 1
the 193
hope 16
that 11
would 5
return 14
to 805
and 51
answer 8
every 10
wish 13
of 109
her 181
heart 57
they 5
agreed 1
that 11
mrs 1
bennet 1
should 7
only 1
hear 76
of 109
the 193
departure 3
of 109
the 193
family 2
without 1
being 3
alarmed 1
on 86
the 193
score 19
of 109
the 193
gentleman's 1
conduct 21
but 82
even 36
this 6
partial 6
communication 3
gave 4
her 181
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
concern 6
and 51
she 199
bewailed 1
it 67
as 509
exceedingly 1
unlucky 1
that 11
the 193
ladies 1
should 7
happen 9
to 805
go 500
away 1
just 24
as 509
they 5
were 5
all 162
getting 1
so 797
intimate 5
together 3
after 48
lamenting 1
it 67
however 1
at 272
some 30
length 14
she 199
had 11
the 193
consolation 3
that 11
mr 5
would 5
be 1200
soon 3
down 90
again 2
and 51
soon 3
dining 1
at 272
and 51
the 193
conclusion 3
of 109
all 162
was 93
the 193
comfortable 3
declaration 3
that 11
though 12
he 962
had 11
been 1
invited 1
only 1
to 805
a 6799
family 2
dinner 9
she 199
would 5
take 18
care 47
to 805
have 11
two 14
full 16
courses 1
chapter 3
the 193
were 5
engaged 1
to 805
dine 9
with 34
the 193
and 51
again 2
during 1
the 193
chief 14
of 109
the 193
day 27
was 93
miss 71
lucas 1
so 797
kind 31
as 509
to 805
listen 9
to 805
mr 5
collins 1
elizabeth 5
took 1
an 970
opportunity 2
of 109
thanking 1
her 181
it 67
keeps 4
him 9
in 2719
good 28
said 1
she 199
and 51
i 4330
am 392
more 11
obliged 1
to 805
you 29
than 22
i 4330
can 287
express 25
charlotte 4
assured 4
her 181
friend 14
of 109
her 181
satisfaction 3
in 2719
being 3
useful 4
and 51
that 11
it 67
amply 1
repaid 1
her 181
for 484
the 193
little 6
sacrifice 4
of 109
her 181
time 45
this 6
was 93
very 1
amiable 1
but 82
charlotte's 1
kindness 3
extended 1
farther 2
than 22
elizabeth 5
had 11
any 17
conception 4
of 109
its 2
object 26
was 93
nothing 5
else 2
than 22
to 805
secure 6
her 181
from 2
any 17
return 14
of 109
mr 5
addresses 1
by 57
engaging 2
them 9
towards 1
herself 1
such 2
was 93
miss 71
scheme 7
and 51
appearances 1
were 5
so 797
that 11
when 6
they 5
parted 1
at 272
night 61
she 199
would 5
have 11
felt 5
almost 1
secure 6
of 109
success 13
if 8
he 962
had 11
not 85
been 1
to 805
leave 14
so 797
very 1
soon 3
but 82
here 31
she 199
did 23
injustice 3
to 805
the 193
fire 103
and 51
independence 2
of 109
his 43
character 16
for 484
it 67
led 11
him 9
to 805
escape 10
out 365
of 109
house 87
the 193
next 2
morning 3
with 34
admirable 1
slyness 2
and 51
hasten 4
to 805
lucas 1
lodge 7
to 805
throw 14
himself 1
at 272
her 181
feet 1
he 962
was 93
anxious 4
to 805
avoid 8
the 193
notice 8
of 109
his 43
cousins 1
from 2
a 6799
conviction 3
that 11
if 8
they 5
saw 24
him 9
depart 19
they 5
could 2
not 85
fail 12
to 805
conjecture 4
his 43
design 16
and 51
he 962
was 93
not 85
willing 4
to 805
have 11
the 193
attempt 5
known 1
till 14
its 2
success 13
might 9
be 1200
known 1
likewise 1
for 484
though 12
feeling 4
almost 1
secure 6
and 51
with 34
reason 13
for 484
charlotte 4
had 11
been 1
tolerably 1
encouraging 2
he 962
was 93
comparatively 1
diffident 2
since 7
the 193
adventure 11
of 109
wednesday 3
his 43
reception 6
however 1
was 93
of 109
the 193
most 3
flattering 2
kind 31
miss 71
lucas 1
perceived 1
him 9
from 2
an 970
upper 15
window 12
as 509
he 962
walked 1
towards 1
the 193
house 87
and 51
instantly 1
set 40
out 365
to 805
meet 9
him 9
accidentally 1
in 2719
the 193
lane 3
but 82
little 6
had 11
she 199
dared 6
to 805
hope 16
that 11
so 797
much 2
love 29
and 51
eloquence 2
awaited 1
her 181
there 21
in 2719
as 509
short 62
a 6799
time 45
as 509
mr 5
long 49
speeches 1
would 5
allow 9
everything 2
was 93
settled 1
between 1
them 9
to 805
the 193
satisfaction 3
of 109
both 8
and 51
as 509
they 5
entered 1
the 193
house 87
he 962
earnestly 1
entreated 1
her 181
to 805
name 17
the 193
day 27
that 11
was 93
to 805
make 17
him 9
the 193
happiest 1
of 109
men 140
and 51
though 12
such 2
a 6799
solicitation 3
must 28
be 1200
waived 1
for 484
the 193
present 20
the 193
lady 18
felt 5
no 896
inclination 3
to 805
trifle 7
with 34
his 43
happiness 2
the 193
stupidity 2
with 34
which 2
he 962
was 93
by 57
nature 3
must 28
guard 26
his 43
courtship 3
from 2
any 17
charm 14
that 11
could 2
make 17
a 6799
woman 21
wish 13
for 484
its 2
continuance 3
and 51
miss 71
lucas 1
who 79
accepted 1
him 9
solely 1
from 2
the 193
pure 14
and 51
disinterested 4
desire 6
of 109
an 970
establishment 3
cared 1
not 85
how 27
soon 3
that 11
establishment 3
were 5
gained 1
sir 22
william 3
and 51
lady 18
lucas 1
were 5
speedily 1
applied 1
to 805
for 484
their 2
consent 5
and 51
it 67
was 93
bestowed 1
with 34
a 6799
most 3
joyful 6
alacrity 2
mr 5
present 20
circumstances 1
made 13
it 67
a 6799
most 3
eligible 1
match 25
for 484
their 2
daughter 4
to 805
whom 3
they 5
could 2
give 15
little 6
fortune 8
and 51
his 43
prospects 1
of 109
future 3
wealth 7
were 5
exceedingly 1
fair 25
lady 18
lucas 1
began 1
directly 1
to 805
calculate 4
with 34
more 11
interest 6
than 22
the 193
matter 7
had 11
ever 33
excited 2
before 2
how 27
many 2
years 1
longer 1
mr 5
bennet 1
was 93
likely 1
to 805
live 43
and 51
sir 22
william 3
gave 4
it 67
as 509
his 43
decided 2
opinion 4
that 11
whenever 1
mr 5
collins 1
should 7
be 1200
in 2719
possession 3
of 109
the 193
estate 3
it 67
would 5
be 1200
highly 1
expedient 4
that 11
both 8
he 962
and 51
his 43
wife 6
should 7
make 17
their 2
appearance 3
at 272
st 1910
james's 1
the 193
whole 26
family 2
in 2719
short 62
were 5
properly 1
overjoyed 1
on 86
the 193
occasion 7
the 193
younger 1
girls 1
formed 1
hopes 1
of 109
coming 3
out 365
a 6799
year 19
or 333
two 14
sooner 1
than 22
they 5
might 9
otherwise 1
have 11
done 3
and 51
the 193
boys 4
were 5
relieved 1
from 2
their 2
apprehension 3
of 109
charlotte's 1
dying 2
an 970
old 21
maid 19
charlotte 4
herself 1
was 93
tolerably 1
composed 2
she 199
had 11
gained 1
her 181
point 22
and 51
had 11
time 45
to 805
consider 13
of 109
it 67
her 181
reflections 1
were 5
in 2719
general 22
satisfactory 1
mr 5
collins 1
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
was 93
neither 1
sensible 3
nor 102
agreeable 3
his 43
society 2
was 93
irksome 4
and 51
his 43
attachment 3
to 805
her 181
must 28
be 1200
imaginary 1
but 82
still 13
he 962
would 5
be 1200
her 181
husband 10
without 1
thinking 2
highly 1
either 1
of 109
men 140
or 333
matrimony 2
marriage 6
had 11
always 1
been 1
her 181
object 26
it 67
was 93
the 193
only 1
provision 7
for 484
well 24
educated 1
young 9
women 5
of 109
small 14
fortune 8
and 51
however 1
uncertain 5
of 109
giving 2
happiness 2
must 28
be 1200
their 2
pleasantest 1
preservative 3
from 2
want 13
this 6
preservative 3
she 199
had 11
now 10
obtained 1
and 51
at 272
the 193
age 24
of 109
twenty 2
seven 18
without 1
having 1
ever 33
been 1
handsome 6
she 199
felt 5
all 162
the 193
good 28
luck 14
of 109
it 67
the 193
least 3
agreeable 3
circumstance 4
in 2719
the 193
business 13
was 93
the 193
surprise 4
it 67
must 28
occasion 7
to 805
elizabeth 5
bennet 1
whose 1
friendship 3
she 199
valued 1
beyond 1
that 11
of 109
any 17
other 5
person 33
elizabeth 5
would 5
wonder 17
and 51
probably 1
would 5
blame 12
her 181
and 51
though 12
her 181
resolution 3
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1200
shaken 1
her 181
feelings 1
must 28
be 1200
hurt 12
by 57
such 2
a 6799
disapprobation 2
she 199
resolved 1
to 805
give 15
her 181
the 193
information 3
herself 1
and 51
therefore 1
charged 1
mr 5
collins 1
when 6
he 962
returned 1
to 805
to 805
dinner 9
to 805
drop 22
no 896
hint 13
of 109
what 14
had 11
passed 1
before 2
any 17
of 109
the 193
family 2
a 6799
promise 4
of 109
secrecy 2
was 93
of 109
course 10
very 1
dutifully 1
given 3
but 82
it 67
could 2
not 85
be 1200
kept 1
without 1
difficulty 2
for 484
the 193
curiosity 2
excited 2
by 57
his 43
long 49
absence 3
burst 4
forth 8
in 2719
such 2
very 1
direct 30
questions 1
on 86
his 43
return 14
as 509
required 1
some 30
ingenuity 2
to 805
evade 6
and 51
he 962
was 93
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
exercising 1
great 12
self 11
denial 3
for 484
he 962
was 93
longing 4
to 805
publish 9
his 43
prosperous 2
love 29
as 509
he 962
was 93
to 805
begin 8
his 43
journey 11
too 50
early 1
on 86
the 193
morrow 3
to 805
see 70
any 17
of 109
the 193
family 2
the 193
ceremony 2
of 109
leave 14
taking 4
was 93
performed 1
when 6
the 193
ladies 1
moved 1
for 484
the 193
night 61
and 51
mrs 1
bennet 1
with 34
great 12
politeness 2
and 51
cordiality 2
said 1
how 27
happy 1
they 5
should 7
be 1200
to 805
see 70
him 9
at 272
again 2
whenever 1
his 43
engagements 1
might 9
allow 9
him 9
to 805
visit 14
them 9
my 90
dear 15
madam 5
he 962
replied 1
this 6
invitation 6
is 124
particularly 1
gratifying 2
because 1
it 67
is 124
what 14
i 4330
have 11
been 1
hoping 1
to 805
receive 8
and 51
you 29
may 49
be 1200
very 1
certain 5
that 11
i 4330
shall 12
avail 8
myself 1
of 109
it 67
as 509
soon 3
as 509
possible 3
they 5
were 5
all 162
astonished 1
and 51
mr 5
bennet 1
who 79
could 2
by 57
no 896
means 1
wish 13
for 484
so 797
speedy 1
a 6799
return 14
immediately 1
said 1
but 82
is 124
there 21
not 85
danger 7
of 109
lady 18
catherine's 1
disapprobation 2
here 31
my 90
good 28
sir 22
you 29
had 11
better 7
neglect 9
your 4
relations 4
than 22
run 50
the 193
risk 11
of 109
offending 1
your 4
patroness 3
my 90
dear 15
sir 22
replied 1
mr 5
collins 1
i 4330
am 392
particularly 1
obliged 1
to 805
you 29
for 484
this 6
friendly 2
caution 6
and 51
you 29
may 49
depend 17
upon 1
my 90
not 85
taking 4
so 797
material 17
a 6799
step 48
without 1
her 181
ladyship's 1
concurrence 3
you 29
cannot 1
be 1200
too 50
much 2
upon 1
your 4
guard 26
risk 11
anything 3
rather 2
than 22
her 181
displeasure 2
and 51
if 8
you 29
find 10
it 67
likely 1
to 805
be 1200
raised 1
by 57
your 4
coming 3
to 805
us 70
again 2
which 2
i 4330
should 7
think 8
exceedingly 1
probable 3
stay 7
quietly 1
at 272
home 90
and 51
be 1200
satisfied 1
that 11
we 444
shall 12
take 18
no 896
believe 6
me 1041
my 90
dear 15
sir 22
my 90
gratitude 2
is 124
warmly 1
excited 2
by 57
such 2
affectionate 2
attention 3
and 51
depend 17
upon 1
it 67
you 29
will 39
speedily 1
receive 8
from 2
me 1041
a 6799
letter 20
of 109
thanks 4
for 484
this 6
and 51
for 484
every 10
other 5
mark 47
of 109
your 4
regard 7
during 1
my 90
stay 7
in 2719
as 509
for 484
my 90
fair 25
cousins 1
though 12
my 90
absence 3
may 49
not 85
be 1200
long 49
enough 2
to 805
render 7
it 67
necessary 2
i 4330
shall 12
now 10
take 18
the 193
liberty 2
of 109
wishing 1
them 9
health 12
and 51
happiness 2
not 85
excepting 1
my 90
cousin 3
elizabeth 5
with 34
proper 9
civilities 1
the 193
ladies 1
then 5
withdrew 1
all 162
of 109
them 9
equally 1
surprised 1
that 11
he 962
meditated 1
a 6799
quick 25
return 14
mrs 1
bennet 1
wished 1
to 805
understand 8
by 57
it 67
that 11
he 962
thought 11
of 109
paying 1
his 43
addresses 1
to 805
one 19
of 109
her 181
younger 1
girls 1
and 51
mary 13
might 9
have 11
been 1
prevailed 1
on 86
to 805
accept 16
him 9
she 199
rated 1
his 43
abilities 1
much 2
higher 2
than 22
any 17
of 109
the 193
others 1
there 21
was 93
a 6799
solidity 2
in 2719
his 43
reflections 1
which 2
often 4
struck 1
her 181
and 51
though 12
by 57
no 896
means 1
so 797
clever 6
as 509
herself 1
she 199
thought 11
that 11
if 8
encouraged 1
to 805
read 49
and 51
improve 6
himself 1
by 57
such 2
an 970
example 4
as 509
hers 9
he 962
might 9
become 2
a 6799
very 1
agreeable 3
companion 10
but 82
on 86
the 193
following 3
morning 3
every 10
hope 16
of 109
this 6
kind 31
was 93
done 3
away 1
miss 71
lucas 1
called 1
soon 3
after 48
breakfast 5
and 51
in 2719
a 6799
private 9
conference 3
with 34
elizabeth 5
related 3
the 193
event 18
of 109
the 193
day 27
before 2
the 193
possibility 2
of 109
mr 5
fancying 1
himself 1
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 181
friend 14
had 11
once 2
occurred 1
to 805
elizabeth 5
within 3
the 193
last 7
day 27
or 333
two 14
but 82
that 11
charlotte 4
could 2
encourage 6
him 9
seemed 1
almost 1
as 509
far 91
from 2
possibility 2
as 509
she 199
could 2
encourage 6
him 9
herself 1
and 51
her 181
astonishment 2
was 93
consequently 1
so 797
great 12
as 509
to 805
overcome 2
at 272
first 8
the 193
bounds 1
of 109
decorum 2
and 51
she 199
could 2
not 85
help 23
crying 2
out 365
engaged 1
to 805
mr 5
collins 1
my 90
dear 15
charlotte 4
impossible 2
the 193
steady 3
countenance 4
which 2
miss 71
lucas 1
had 11
commanded 1
in 2719
telling 2
her 181
story 13
gave 4
way 27
to 805
a 6799
momentary 1
confusion 3
here 31
on 86
receiving 1
so 797
direct 30
a 6799
reproach 8
though 12
as 509
it 67
was 93
no 896
more 11
than 22
she 199
expected 1
she 199
soon 3
regained 1
her 181
composure 2
and 51
calmly 1
replied 1
why 4
should 7
you 29
be 1200
surprised 1
my 90
dear 15
eliza 7
do 814
you 29
think 8
it 67
incredible 1
that 11
mr 5
collins 1
should 7
be 1200
able 3
to 805
procure 8
any 17
woman's 1
good 28
opinion 4
because 1
he 962
was 93
not 85
so 797
happy 1
as 509
to 805
succeed 4
with 34
you 29
but 82
elizabeth 5
had 11
now 10
recollected 1
herself 1
and 51
making 4
a 6799
strong 16
effort 7
for 484
it 67
was 93
able 3
to 805
assure 6
with 34
tolerable 1
firmness 2
that 11
the 193
prospect 13
of 109
their 2
relationship 3
was 93
highly 1
grateful 4
to 805
her 181
and 51
that 11
she 199
wished 1
her 181
all 162
imaginable 1
happiness 2
i 4330
see 70
what 14
you 29
are 12
feeling 4
replied 1
charlotte 4
you 29
must 28
be 1200
surprised 1
very 1
much 2
surprised 1
so 797
lately 1
as 509
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
wishing 1
to 805
marry 2
you 29
but 82
when 6
you 29
have 11
had 11
time 45
to 805
think 8
it 67
over 596
i 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 39
be 1200
satisfied 1
with 34
what 14
i 4330
have 11
done 3
i 4330
am 392
not 85
romantic 13
you 29
know 12
i 4330
never 3
was 93
i 4330
ask 6
only 1
a 6799
comfortable 3
home 90
and 51
considering 1
mr 5
character 16
connection 3
and 51
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
i 4330
am 392
convinced 1
that 11
my 90
chance 20
of 109
happiness 2
with 34
him 9
is 124
as 509
fair 25
as 509
most 3
people 4
can 287
boast 12
on 86
entering 1
the 193
marriage 6
state 41
elizabeth 5
quietly 1
answered 1
undoubtedly 1
and 51
after 48
an 970
awkward 6
pause 4
they 5
returned 1
to 805
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
family 2
charlotte 4
did 23
not 85
stay 7
much 2
longer 1
and 51
elizabeth 5
was 93
then 5
left 19
to 805
reflect 12
on 86
what 14
she 199
had 11
heard 1
it 67
was 93
a 6799
long 49
time 45
before 2
she 199
became 1
at 272
all 162
reconciled 1
to 805
the 193
idea 21
of 109
so 797
unsuitable 1
a 6799
match 25
the 193
strangeness 2
of 109
mr 5
making 4
two 14
offers 1
of 109
marriage 6
within 3
three 12
days 1
was 93
nothing 5
in 2719
comparison 3
of 109
his 43
being 3
now 10
accepted 1
she 199
had 11
always 1
felt 5
that 11
charlotte's 1
opinion 4
of 109
matrimony 2
was 93
not 85
exactly 1
like 22
her 181
own 9
but 82
she 199
had 11
not 85
supposed 2
it 67
to 805
be 1200
possible 3
that 11
when 6
called 1
into 26
action 4
she 199
would 5
have 11
sacrificed 1
every 10
better 7
feeling 4
to 805
worldly 1
advantage 6
charlotte 4
the 193
wife 6
of 109
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
a 6799
most 3
humiliating 2
picture 8
and 51
to 805
the 193
pang 5
of 109
a 6799
friend 14
disgracing 1
herself 1
and 51
sunk 4
in 2719
her 181
esteem 5
was 93
added 1
the 193
distressing 2
conviction 3
that 11
it 67
was 93
impossible 2
for 484
that 11
friend 14
to 805
be 1200
tolerably 1
happy 1
in 2719
the 193
lot 21
she 199
had 11
chosen 1
chapter 3
elizabeth 5
was 93
sitting 3
with 34
her 181
mother 21
and 51
sisters 1
reflecting 1
on 86
what 14
she 199
had 11
heard 1
and 51
doubting 2
whether 1
she 199
was 93
to 805
mention 5
it 67
when 6
sir 22
william 3
lucas 1
himself 1
appeared 1
sent 35
by 57
his 43
daughter 4
to 805
announce 9
her 181
engagement 3
to 805
the 193
family 2
with 34
many 2
compliments 1
to 805
them 9
and 51
much 2
self 11
on 86
the 193
prospect 13
of 109
a 6799
connection 3
between 1
the 193
houses 1
he 962
unfolded 1
the 193
matter 7
to 805
an 970
audience 3
not 85
merely 1
wondering 2
but 82
incredulous 2
for 484
mrs 1
bennet 1
with 34
more 11
perseverance 2
than 22
politeness 2
protested 1
he 962
must 28
be 1200
entirely 1
mistaken 2
and 51
lydia 4
always 1
unguarded 1
and 51
often 4
uncivil 3
boisterously 1
exclaimed 1
good 28
lord 13
sir 22
william 3
how 27
can 287
you 29
tell 16
such 2
a 6799
story 13
do 814
not 85
you 29
know 12
that 11
mr 5
collins 1
wants 1
to 805
marry 2
lizzy 2
nothing 5
less 19
than 22
the 193
complaisance 2
of 109
a 6799
courtier 3
could 2
have 11
borne 3
without 1
anger 5
such 2
treatment 3
but 82
sir 22
good 28
breeding 2
carried 1
him 9
through 4
it 67
all 162
and 51
though 12
he 962
begged 1
leave 14
to 805
be 1200
positive 6
as 509
to 805
the 193
truth 7
of 109
his 43
information 3
he 962
listened 1
to 805
all 162
their 2
impertinence 3
with 34
the 193
most 3
forbearing 1
courtesy 2
elizabeth 5
feeling 4
it 67
incumbent 3
on 86
her 181
to 805
relieve 6
him 9
from 2
so 797
unpleasant 4
a 6799
situation 3
now 10
put 47
herself 1
forward 12
to 805
confirm 8
his 43
account 14
by 57
mentioning 1
her 181
prior 17
knowledge 4
of 109
it 67
from 2
charlotte 4
herself 1
and 51
to 805
put 47
a 6799
stop 36
to 805
the 193
exclamations 1
of 109
her 181
mother 21
and 51
sisters 1
by 57
the 193
earnestness 2
of 109
her 181
congratulations 1
to 805
sir 22
william 3
in 2719
which 2
she 199
was 93
readily 1
joined 1
by 57
jane 8
and 51
by 57
making 4
a 6799
variety 2
of 109
remarks 1
on 86
the 193
happiness 2
that 11
might 9
be 1200
expected 1
from 2
the 193
match 25
the 193
excellent 2
character 16
of 109
mr 5
collins 1
and 51
the 193
convenient 2
distance 4
of 109
from 2
london 5
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
in 2719
fact 35
too 50
much 2
overpowered 1
to 805
say 7
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
while 4
sir 22
william 3
remained 1
but 82
no 896
sooner 1
had 11
he 962
left 19
them 9
than 22
her 181
feelings 1
found 18
a 6799
rapid 10
vent 41
in 2719
the 193
first 8
place 29
she 199
persisted 1
in 2719
disbelieving 2
the 193
whole 26
of 109
the 193
matter 7
secondly 1
she 199
was 93
very 1
sure 11
that 11
mr 5
collins 1
had 11
been 1
taken 1
in 2719
thirdly 1
she 199
trusted 1
that 11
they 5
would 5
never 3
be 1200
happy 1
together 3
and 51
fourthly 1
that 11
the 193
match 25
might 9
be 1200
broken 6
off 100
two 14
inferences 1
however 1
were 5
plainly 1
deduced 1
from 2
the 193
whole 26
one 19
that 11
elizabeth 5
was 93
the 193
real 47
cause 14
of 109
the 193
mischief 2
and 51
the 193
other 5
that 11
she 199
herself 1
had 11
been 1
barbarously 1
misused 1
by 57
them 9
all 162
and 51
on 86
these 4
two 14
points 1
she 199
principally 1
dwelt 1
during 1
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
day 27
nothing 5
could 2
console 4
and 51
nothing 5
could 2
appease 9
her 181
nor 102
did 23
that 11
day 27
wear 20
out 365
her 181
resentment 3
a 6799
week 20
elapsed 1
before 2
she 199
could 2
see 70
elizabeth 5
without 1
scolding 3
her 181
a 6799
month 6
passed 1
away 1
before 2
she 199
could 2
speak 12
to 805
sir 22
william 3
or 333
lady 18
lucas 1
without 1
being 3
rude 6
and 51
many 2
months 1
were 5
gone 4
before 2
she 199
could 2
at 272
all 162
forgive 8
their 2
daughter 4
mr 5
emotions 1
were 5
much 2
more 11
tranquil 13
on 86
the 193
occasion 7
and 51
such 2
as 509
he 962
did 23
experience 4
he 962
pronounced 1
to 805
be 1200
of 109
a 6799
most 3
agreeable 3
sort 14
for 484
it 67
gratified 1
him 9
he 962
said 1
to 805
discover 10
that 11
charlotte 4
lucas 1
whom 3
he 962
had 11
been 1
used 1
to 805
think 8
tolerably 1
sensible 3
was 93
as 509
foolish 4
as 509
his 43
wife 6
and 51
more 11
foolish 4
than 22
his 43
daughter 4
jane 8
confessed 2
herself 1
a 6799
little 6
surprised 1
at 272
the 193
match 25
but 82
she 199
said 1
less 19
of 109
her 181
astonishment 2
than 22
of 109
her 181
earnest 8
desire 6
for 484
their 2
happiness 2
nor 102
could 2
elizabeth 5
persuade 6
her 181
to 805
consider 13
it 67
as 509
improbable 1
kitty 2
and 51
lydia 4
were 5
far 91
from 2
envying 2
miss 71
lucas 1
for 484
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
only 1
a 6799
clergyman 2
and 51
it 67
affected 2
them 9
in 2719
no 896
other 5
way 27
than 22
as 509
a 6799
piece 10
of 109
news 71
to 805
spread 12
at 272
lady 18
lucas 1
could 2
not 85
be 1200
insensible 1
of 109
triumph 10
on 86
being 3
able 3
to 805
retort 5
on 86
mrs 1
bennet 1
the 193
comfort 14
of 109
having 1
a 6799
daughter 4
well 24
married 3
and 51
she 199
called 1
at 272
rather 2
oftener 1
than 22
usual 3
to 805
say 7
how 27
happy 1
she 199
was 93
though 12
mrs 1
sour 22
looks 1
and 51
ill 84
remarks 1
might 9
have 11
been 1
enough 2
to 805
drive 18
happiness 2
away 1
between 1
elizabeth 5
and 51
charlotte 4
there 21
was 93
a 6799
restraint 3
which 2
kept 1
them 9
mutually 1
silent 6
on 86
the 193
subject 11
and 51
elizabeth 5
felt 5
persuaded 1
that 11
no 896
real 47
confidence 3
could 2
ever 33
subsist 6
between 1
them 9
again 2
her 181
disappointment 3
in 2719
charlotte 4
made 13
her 181
turn 46
with 34
fonder 1
regard 7
to 805
her 181
sister 9
of 109
whose 1
rectitude 2
and 51
delicacy 2
she 199
was 93
sure 11
her 181
opinion 4
could 2
never 3
be 1200
shaken 1
and 51
for 484
whose 1
happiness 2
she 199
grew 1
daily 2
more 11
anxious 4
as 509
had 11
now 10
been 1
gone 4
a 6799
week 20
and 51
nothing 5
more 11
was 93
heard 1
of 109
his 43
return 14
jane 8
had 11
sent 35
caroline 1
an 970
early 1
answer 8
to 805
her 181
letter 20
and 51
was 93
counting 1
the 193
days 1
till 14
she 199
might 9
reasonably 1
hope 16
to 805
hear 76
again 2
the 193
promised 1
letter 20
of 109
thanks 4
from 2
mr 5
collins 1
arrived 1
on 86
tuesday 3
addressed 1
to 805
their 2
father 12
and 51
written 1
with 34
all 162
the 193
solemnity 2
of 109
gratitude 2
which 2
a 6799
twelvemonth's 1
abode 3
in 2719
the 193
family 2
might 9
have 11
prompted 1
after 48
discharging 1
his 43
conscience 4
on 86
that 11
head 140
he 962
proceeded 1
to 805
inform 21
them 9
with 34
many 2
rapturous 2
expressions 1
of 109
his 43
happiness 2
in 2719
having 1
obtained 1
the 193
affection 5
of 109
their 2
amiable 1
miss 71
lucas 1
and 51
then 5
explained 1
that 11
it 67
was 93
merely 1
with 34
the 193
view 18
of 109
enjoying 1
her 181
society 2
that 11
he 962
had 11
been 1
so 797
ready 2
to 805
close 22
with 34
their 2
kind 31
wish 13
of 109
seeing 2
him 9
again 2
at 272
whither 1
he 962
hoped 1
to 805
be 1200
able 3
to 805
return 14
on 86
monday 3
fortnight 4
for 484
lady 18
catherine 2
he 962
added 1
so 797
heartily 1
approved 1
his 43
marriage 6
that 11
she 199
wished 1
it 67
to 805
take 18
place 29
as 509
soon 3
as 509
possible 3
which 2
he 962
trusted 1
would 5
be 1200
an 970
unanswerable 1
argument 9
with 34
his 43
amiable 1
charlotte 4
to 805
name 17
an 970
early 1
day 27
for 484
making 4
him 9
the 193
happiest 1
of 109
men 140
mr 5
return 14
into 26
was 93
no 896
longer 1
a 6799
matter 7
of 109
pleasure 5
to 805
mrs 1
bennet 1
on 86
the 193
contrary 2
she 199
was 93
as 509
much 2
disposed 1
to 805
complain 13
of 109
it 67
as 509
her 181
husband 10
it 67
was 93
very 1
strange 8
that 11
he 962
should 7
come 36
to 805
instead 1
of 109
to 805
lucas 1
lodge 7
it 67
was 93
also 3
very 1
inconvenient 2
and 51
exceedingly 1
troublesome 2
she 199
hated 1
having 1
visitors 1
in 2719
the 193
house 87
while 4
her 181
health 12
was 93
so 797
indifferent 2
and 51
lovers 1
were 5
of 109
all 162
people 4
the 193
most 3
disagreeable 3
such 2
were 5
the 193
gentle 18
murmurs 1
of 109
mrs 1
bennet 1
and 51
they 5
gave 4
way 27
only 1
to 805
the 193
greater 1
distress 7
of 109
mr 5
continued 1
absence 3
neither 1
jane 8
nor 102
elizabeth 5
were 5
comfortable 3
on 86
this 6
subject 11
day 27
after 48
day 27
passed 1
away 1
without 1
bringing 1
any 17
other 5
tidings 2
of 109
him 9
than 22
the 193
report 12
which 2
shortly 1
prevailed 1
in 2719
of 109
his 43
coming 3
no 896
more 11
to 805
the 193
whole 26
winter 13
a 6799
report 12
which 2
highly 1
incensed 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
and 51
which 2
she 199
never 3
failed 1
to 805
contradict 8
as 509
a 6799
most 3
scandalous 2
falsehood 3
even 36
elizabeth 5
began 1
to 805
fear 14
not 85
that 11
was 93
indifferent 2
but 82
that 11
his 43
sisters 1
would 5
be 1200
successful 2
in 2719
keeping 2
him 9
away 1
unwilling 4
as 509
she 199
was 93
to 805
admit 7
an 970
idea 21
so 797
destructive 4
of 109
happiness 2
and 51
so 797
dishonorable 1
to 805
the 193
stability 2
of 109
her 181
lover 3
she 199
could 2
not 85
prevent 13
its 2
frequently 1
occurring 1
the 193
united 2
efforts 1
of 109
his 43
two 14
unfeeling 2
sisters 1
and 51
of 109
his 43
overpowering 2
friend 14
assisted 1
by 57
the 193
attractions 1
of 109
miss 71
darcy 2
and 51
the 193
amusements 1
of 109
london 5
might 9
be 1200
too 50
much 2
she 199
feared 1
for 484
the 193
strength 10
of 109
his 43
attachment 3
as 509
for 484
jane 8
her 181
anxiety 2
under 288
this 6
suspense 3
was 93
of 109
course 10
more 11
painful 6
than 22
elizabeth's 1
but 82
whatever 1
she 199
felt 5
she 199
was 93
desirous 1
of 109
concealing 1
and 51
between 1
herself 1
and 51
elizabeth 5
therefore 1
the 193
subject 11
was 93
never 3
alluded 1
to 805
but 82
as 509
no 896
such 2
delicacy 2
restrained 1
her 181
mother 21
an 970
hour 10
seldom 1
passed 1
in 2719
which 2
she 199
did 23
not 85
talk 18
of 109
express 25
her 181
impatience 3
for 484
his 43
arrival 3
or 333
even 36
require 6
jane 8
to 805
confess 14
that 11
if 8
he 962
did 23
not 85
come 36
back 182
she 199
would 5
think 8
herself 1
very 1
ill 84
used 1
it 67
needed 1
all 162
steady 3
mildness 2
to 805
bear 30
these 4
attacks 1
with 34
tolerable 1
mr 5
collins 1
returned 1
most 3
punctually 1
on 86
monday 3
fortnight 4
but 82
his 43
reception 6
at 272
was 93
not 85
quite 1
so 797
gracious 4
as 509
it 67
had 11
been 1
on 86
his 43
first 8
introduction 3
he 962
was 93
too 50
happy 1
however 1
to 805
need 29
much 2
attention 3
and 51
luckily 1
for 484
the 193
others 1
the 193
business 13
of 109
love 29
making 4
relieved 1
them 9
from 2
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
his 43
company 2
the 193
chief 14
of 109
every 10
day 27
was 93
spent 1
by 57
him 9
at 272
lucas 1
lodge 7
and 51
he 962
sometimes 1
returned 1
to 805
only 1
in 2719
time 45
to 805
make 17
an 970
apology 2
for 484
his 43
absence 3
before 2
the 193
family 2
went 1
to 805
bed 93
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
really 1
in 2719
a 6799
most 3
pitiable 1
state 41
the 193
very 1
mention 5
of 109
anything 3
concerning 1
the 193
match 25
threw 1
her 181
into 26
an 970
agony 2
of 109
ill 84
and 51
wherever 1
she 199
went 1
she 199
was 93
sure 11
of 109
hearing 3
it 67
talked 1
of 109
the 193
sight 17
of 109
miss 71
lucas 1
was 93
odious 4
to 805
her 181
as 509
her 181
successor 3
in 2719
that 11
house 87
she 199
regarded 1
her 181
with 34
jealous 5
abhorrence 2
whenever 1
charlotte 4
came 36
to 805
see 70
them 9
she 199
concluded 1
her 181
to 805
be 1200
anticipating 1
the 193
hour 10
of 109
possession 3
and 51
whenever 1
she 199
spoke 14
in 2719
a 6799
low 46
voice 8
to 805
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
convinced 1
that 11
they 5
were 5
talking 1
of 109
the 193
estate 3
and 51
resolving 1
to 805
turn 46
herself 1
and 51
her 181
daughters 1
out 365
of 109
the 193
house 87
as 509
soon 3
as 509
mr 5
bennet 1
were 5
dead 39
she 199
complained 1
bitterly 1
of 109
all 162
this 6
to 805
her 181
husband 10
indeed 1
mr 5
bennet 1
said 1
she 199
it 67
is 124
very 1
hard 70
to 805
think 8
that 11
charlotte 4
lucas 1
should 7
ever 33
be 1200
mistress 3
of 109
this 6
house 87
that 11
i 4330
should 7
be 1200
forced 1
to 805
make 17
way 27
for 484
her 181
and 51
live 43
to 805
see 70
her 181
take 18
her 181
place 29
in 2719
it 67
my 90
dear 15
do 814
not 85
give 15
way 27
to 805
such 2
gloomy 1
thoughts 1
let 50
us 70
hope 16
for 484
better 7
things 1
let 50
us 70
flatter 10
ourselves 1
that 11
i 4330
may 49
be 1200
the 193
survivor 3
this 6
was 93
not 85
very 1
consoling 2
to 805
mrs 1
bennet 1
and 51
therefore 1
instead 1
of 109
making 4
any 17
answer 8
she 199
went 1
on 86
as 509
before 2
i 4330
cannot 1
bear 30
to 805
think 8
that 11
they 5
should 7
have 11
all 162
this 6
estate 3
if 8
it 67
was 93
not 85
for 484
the 193
entail 6
i 4330
should 7
not 85
mind 25
it 67
what 14
should 7
not 85
you 29
mind 25
i 4330
should 7
not 85
mind 25
anything 3
at 272
all 162
let 50
us 70
be 1200
thankful 4
that 11
you 29
are 12
preserved 1
from 2
a 6799
state 41
of 109
such 2
insensibility 2
i 4330
never 3
can 287
be 1200
thankful 4
mr 5
bennet 1
for 484
anything 3
about 1
the 193
entail 6
how 27
anyone 2
could 2
have 11
the 193
conscience 4
to 805
entail 6
away 1
an 970
estate 3
from 2
one's 1
own 9
daughters 1
i 4330
cannot 1
understand 8
and 51
all 162
for 484
the 193
sake 2
of 109
mr 5
collins 1
too 50
why 4
should 7
he 962
have 11
it 67
more 11
than 22
anybody 2
else 2
i 4330
leave 14
it 67
to 805
yourself 1
to 805
determine 7
said 1
mr 5
bennet 1
chapter 3
miss 71
letter 20
arrived 1
and 51
put 47
an 970
end 92
to 805
doubt 15
the 193
very 1
first 8
sentence 4
conveyed 1
the 193
assurance 3
of 109
their 2
being 3
all 162
settled 1
in 2719
london 5
for 484
the 193
winter 13
and 51
concluded 1
with 34
her 181
brother's 1
regret 9
at 272
not 85
having 1
had 11
time 45
to 805
pay 52
his 43
respects 1
to 805
his 43
friends 4
in 2719
before 2
he 962
left 19
the 193
country 12
hope 16
was 93
over 596
entirely 1
over 596
and 51
when 6
jane 8
could 2
attend 15
to 805
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
letter 20
she 199
found 18
little 6
except 10
the 193
professed 2
affection 5
of 109
the 193
writer 3
that 11
could 2
give 15
her 181
any 17
comfort 14
miss 71
darcy's 1
praise 7
occupied 1
the 193
chief 14
of 109
it 67
her 181
many 2
attractions 1
were 5
again 2
dwelt 1
on 86
and 51
caroline 1
boasted 1
joyfully 1
of 109
their 2
increasing 2
intimacy 2
and 51
ventured 1
to 805
predict 15
the 193
accomplishment 3
of 109
the 193
wishes 1
which 2
had 11
been 1
unfolded 1
in 2719
her 181
former 3
letter 20
she 199
wrote 1
also 3
with 34
great 12
pleasure 5
of 109
her 181
brother's 1
being 3
an 970
inmate 3
of 109
mr 5
darcy's 1
house 87
and 51
mentioned 1
with 34
raptures 1
some 30
plans 1
of 109
the 193
latter 3
with 34
regard 7
to 805
new 115
furniture 2
elizabeth 5
to 805
whom 3
jane 8
very 1
soon 3
communicated 1
the 193
chief 14
of 109
all 162
this 6
heard 1
it 67
in 2719
silent 6
indignation 2
her 181
heart 57
was 93
divided 1
between 1
concern 6
for 484
her 181
sister 9
and 51
resentment 3
against 1
all 162
others 1
to 805
assertion 3
of 109
her 181
brother's 1
being 3
partial 6
to 805
miss 71
darcy 2
she 199
paid 1
no 896
credit 12
that 11
he 962
was 93
really 1
fond 17
of 109
jane 8
she 199
doubted 1
no 896
more 11
than 22
she 199
had 11
ever 33
done 3
and 51
much 2
as 509
she 199
had 11
always 1
been 1
disposed 1
to 805
like 22
him 9
she 199
could 2
not 85
think 8
without 1
anger 5
hardly 1
without 1
contempt 8
on 86
that 11
easiness 2
of 109
temper 22
that 11
want 13
of 109
proper 9
resolution 3
which 2
now 10
made 13
him 9
the 193
slave 14
of 109
his 43
designing 2
friends 4
and 51
led 11
him 9
to 805
sacrifice 4
of 109
his 43
own 9
happiness 2
to 805
the 193
caprice 3
of 109
their 2
inclination 3
had 11
his 43
own 9
happiness 2
however 1
been 1
the 193
only 1
sacrifice 4
he 962
might 9
have 11
been 1
allowed 1
to 805
sport 36
with 34
it 67
in 2719
whatever 1
manner 8
he 962
thought 11
best 37
but 82
her 181
sister's 1
was 93
involved 1
in 2719
it 67
as 509
she 199
thought 11
he 962
must 28
be 1200
sensible 3
himself 1
it 67
was 93
a 6799
subject 11
in 2719
short 62
on 86
which 2
reflection 3
would 5
be 1200
long 49
indulged 1
and 51
must 28
be 1200
unavailing 2
she 199
could 2
think 8
of 109
nothing 5
else 2
and 51
yet 4
whether 1
regard 7
had 11
really 1
died 1
away 1
or 333
were 5
suppressed 1
by 57
his 43
interference 2
whether 1
he 962
had 11
been 1
aware 3
of 109
attachment 3
or 333
whether 1
it 67
had 11
escaped 1
his 43
observation 4
whatever 1
were 5
the 193
case 25
though 12
her 181
opinion 4
of 109
him 9
must 28
be 1200
materially 1
affected 2
by 57
the 193
difference 3
her 181
sister's 1
situation 3
remained 1
the 193
same 5
her 181
peace 21
equally 1
wounded 1
a 6799
day 27
or 333
two 14
passed 1
before 2
jane 8
had 11
courage 6
to 805
speak 12
of 109
her 181
feelings 1
to 805
elizabeth 5
but 82
at 272
last 7
on 86
mrs 1
leaving 3
them 9
together 3
after 48
a 6799
longer 1
irritation 3
than 22
usual 3
about 1
and 51
its 2
master 28
she 199
could 2
not 85
help 23
saying 3
oh 17
that 11
my 90
dear 15
mother 21
had 11
more 11
command 21
over 596
herself 1
she 199
can 287
have 11
no 896
idea 21
of 109
the 193
pain 42
she 199
gives 1
me 1041
by 57
her 181
continual 2
reflections 1
on 86
him 9
but 82
i 4330
will 39
not 85
repine 3
it 67
cannot 1
last 7
long 49
he 962
will 39
be 1200
forgot 2
and 51
we 444
shall 12
all 162
be 1200
as 509
we 444
were 5
before 2
elizabeth 5
looked 1
at 272
her 181
sister 9
with 34
incredulous 2
solicitude 2
but 82
said 1
nothing 5
you 29
doubt 15
me 1041
cried 1
jane 8
slightly 1
indeed 1
you 29
have 11
no 896
reason 13
he 962
may 49
live 43
in 2719
my 90
memory 2
as 509
the 193
most 3
amiable 1
man 342
of 109
my 90
acquaintance 5
but 82
that 11
is 124
all 162
i 4330
have 11
nothing 5
either 1
to 805
hope 16
or 333
fear 14
and 51
nothing 5
to 805
reproach 8
him 9
with 34
thank 15
god 61
i 4330
have 11
not 85
that 11
pain 42
a 6799
little 6
time 45
therefore 1
i 4330
shall 12
certainly 1
try 12
to 805
get 13
the 193
better 7
with 34
a 6799
stronger 1
voice 8
she 199
soon 3
added 1
i 4330
have 11
this 6
comfort 14
immediately 1
that 11
it 67
has 41
not 85
been 1
more 11
than 22
an 970
error 3
of 109
fancy 5
on 86
my 90
side 74
and 51
that 11
it 67
has 41
done 3
no 896
harm 41
to 805
anyone 2
but 82
myself 1
my 90
dear 15
jane 8
exclaimed 1
elizabeth 5
you 29
are 12
too 50
good 28
your 4
sweetness 2
and 51
disinterestedness 2
are 12
really 1
angelic 6
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
what 14
to 805
say 7
to 805
you 29
i 4330
feel 11
as 509
if 8
i 4330
had 11
never 3
done 3
you 29
justice 3
or 333
loved 1
you 29
as 509
you 29
deserve 4
miss 71
bennet 1
eagerly 1
disclaimed 1
all 162
extraordinary 1
merit 13
and 51
threw 1
back 182
the 193
praise 7
on 86
her 181
sister's 1
warm 23
affection 5
nay 6
said 1
elizabeth 5
this 6
is 124
not 85
fair 25
you 29
wish 13
to 805
think 8
all 162
the 193
world 12
respectable 1
and 51
are 12
hurt 12
if 8
i 4330
speak 12
ill 84
of 109
anybody 2
i 4330
only 1
want 13
to 805
think 8
you 29
perfect 24
and 51
you 29
set 40
yourself 1
against 1
it 67
do 814
not 85
be 1200
afraid 1
of 109
my 90
running 2
into 26
any 17
excess 5
of 109
my 90
encroaching 1
on 86
your 4
privilege 4
of 109
universal 10
good 28
will 39
you 29
need 29
not 85
there 21
are 12
few 6
people 4
whom 3
i 4330
really 1
love 29
and 51
still 13
fewer 1
of 109
whom 3
i 4330
think 8
well 24
the 193
more 11
i 4330
see 70
of 109
the 193
world 12
the 193
more 11
am 392
i 4330
dissatisfied 1
with 34
it 67
and 51
every 10
day 27
confirms 1
my 90
belief 3
of 109
the 193
inconsistency 2
of 109
all 162
human 41
characters 1
and 51
of 109
the 193
little 6
dependence 2
that 11
can 287
be 1200
placed 1
on 86
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
merit 13
or 333
sense 8
i 4330
have 11
met 180
with 34
two 14
instances 1
lately 1
one 19
i 4330
will 39
not 85
mention 5
the 193
other 5
is 124
charlotte's 1
marriage 6
it 67
is 124
unaccountable 1
in 2719
every 10
view 18
it 67
is 124
unaccountable 1
my 90
dear 15
lizzy 2
do 814
not 85
give 15
way 27
to 805
such 2
feelings 1
as 509
these 4
they 5
will 39
ruin 10
your 4
happiness 2
you 29
do 814
not 85
make 17
allowance 3
enough 2
for 484
difference 3
of 109
situation 3
and 51
temper 22
consider 13
mr 5
respectability 2
and 51
charlotte's 1
steady 3
prudent 5
character 16
remember 4
that 11
she 199
is 124
one 19
of 109
a 6799
large 11
family 2
that 11
as 509
to 805
fortune 8
it 67
is 124
a 6799
most 3
eligible 1
match 25
and 51
be 1200
ready 2
to 805
believe 6
for 484
everybody's 1
sake 2
that 11
she 199
may 49
feel 11
something 3
like 22
regard 7
and 51
esteem 5
for 484
our 3
cousin 3
to 805
oblige 3
you 29
i 4330
would 5
try 12
to 805
believe 6
almost 1
anything 3
but 82
no 896
one 19
else 2
could 2
be 1200
benefited 1
by 57
such 2
a 6799
belief 3
as 509
this 6
for 484
were 5
i 4330
persuaded 1
that 11
charlotte 4
had 11
any 17
regard 7
for 484
him 9
i 4330
should 7
only 1
think 8
worse 6
of 109
her 181
understanding 4
than 22
i 4330
now 10
do 814
of 109
her 181
heart 57
my 90
dear 15
jane 8
mr 5
collins 1
is 124
a 6799
conceited 4
pompous 4
narrow 10
minded 2
silly 2
man 342
you 29
know 12
he 962
is 124
as 509
well 24
as 509
i 4330
do 814
and 51
you 29
must 28
feel 11
as 509
well 24
as 509
i 4330
do 814
that 11
the 193
woman 21
who 79
married 3
him 9
cannot 1
have 11
a 6799
proper 9
way 27
of 109
thinking 2
you 29
shall 12
not 85
defend 10
her 181
though 12
it 67
is 124
charlotte 4
lucas 1
you 29
shall 12
not 85
for 484
the 193
sake 2
of 109
one 19
individual 19
change 21
the 193
meaning 11
of 109
principle 4
and 51
integrity 2
nor 102
to 805
persuade 6
yourself 1
or 333
me 1041
that 11
selfishness 2
is 124
prudence 2
and 51
insensibility 2
of 109
danger 7
security 2
for 484
happiness 2
i 4330
must 28
think 8
your 4
language 3
too 50
strong 16
in 2719
speaking 2
of 109
both 8
replied 1
jane 8
and 51
i 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 39
be 1200
convinced 1
of 109
it 67
by 57
seeing 2
them 9
happy 1
together 3
but 82
enough 2
of 109
this 6
you 29
alluded 1
to 805
something 3
else 2
you 29
mentioned 1
two 14
instances 1
i 4330
cannot 1
misunderstand 5
you 29
but 82
i 4330
entreat 8
you 29
dear 15
lizzy 2
not 85
to 805
pain 42
me 1041
by 57
thinking 2
that 11
person 33
to 805
blame 12
and 51
saying 3
your 4
opinion 4
of 109
him 9
is 124
sunk 4
we 444
must 28
not 85
be 1200
so 797
ready 2
to 805
fancy 5
ourselves 1
intentionally 1
injured 1
we 444
must 28
not 85
expect 20
a 6799
lively 1
young 9
man 342
to 805
be 1200
always 1
so 797
guarded 2
and 51
circumspect 4
it 67
is 124
very 1
often 4
nothing 5
but 82
our 3
own 9
vanity 2
that 11
deceives 1
us 70
women 5
fancy 5
admiration 2
means 1
more 11
than 22
it 67
does 5
and 51
men 140
take 18
care 47
that 11
they 5
should 7
if 8
it 67
is 124
done 3
they 5
cannot 1
be 1200
justified 1
but 82
i 4330
have 11
no 896
idea 21
of 109
there 21
being 3
so 797
much 2
design 16
in 2719
the 193
world 12
as 509
some 30
persons 1
imagine 3
i 4330
am 392
far 91
from 2
attributing 1
any 17
part 102
of 109
mr 5
conduct 21
to 805
design 16
said 1
elizabeth 5
but 82
without 1
scheming 1
to 805
do 814
wrong 24
or 333
to 805
make 17
others 1
unhappy 1
there 21
may 49
be 1200
error 3
and 51
there 21
may 49
be 1200
misery 2
thoughtlessness 2
want 13
of 109
attention 3
to 805
other 5
people's 1
feelings 1
and 51
want 13
of 109
resolution 3
will 39
do 814
the 193
business 13
and 51
do 814
you 29
impute 3
it 67
to 805
either 1
of 109
those 1
yes 16
to 805
the 193
last 7
but 82
if 8
i 4330
go 500
on 86
i 4330
shall 12
displease 3
you 29
by 57
saying 3
what 14
i 4330
think 8
of 109
persons 1
you 29
esteem 5
stop 36
me 1041
whilst 1
you 29
can 287
you 29
persist 8
then 5
in 2719
supposing 1
his 43
sisters 1
influence 4
him 9
yes 16
in 2719
conjunction 3
with 34
his 43
friend 14
i 4330
cannot 1
believe 6
it 67
why 4
should 7
they 5
try 12
to 805
influence 4
him 9
they 5
can 287
only 1
wish 13
his 43
happiness 2
and 51
if 8
he 962
is 124
attached 1
to 805
me 1041
no 896
other 5
woman 21
can 287
secure 6
it 67
your 4
first 8
position 6
is 124
false 12
they 5
may 49
wish 13
many 2
things 1
besides 1
his 43
happiness 2
they 5
may 49
wish 13
his 43
increase 4
of 109
wealth 7
and 51
consequence 3
they 5
may 49
wish 13
him 9
to 805
marry 2
a 6799
girl 14
who 79
has 41
all 162
the 193
importance 2
of 109
money 17
great 12
connections 1
and 51
pride 6
beyond 1
a 6799
doubt 15
they 5
do 814
wish 13
him 9
to 805
choose 5
miss 71
darcy 2
replied 1
jane 8
but 82
this 6
may 49
be 1200
from 2
better 7
feelings 1
than 22
you 29
are 12
supposing 1
they 5
have 11
known 1
her 181
much 2
longer 1
than 22
they 5
have 11
known 1
me 1041
no 896
wonder 17
if 8
they 5
love 29
her 181
better 7
but 82
whatever 1
may 49
be 1200
their 2
own 9
wishes 1
it 67
is 124
very 1
unlikely 1
they 5
should 7
have 11
opposed 1
their 2
brother's 1
what 14
sister 9
would 5
think 8
herself 1
at 272
liberty 2
to 805
do 814
it 67
unless 1
there 21
were 5
something 3
very 1
objectionable 1
if 8
they 5
believed 1
him 9
attached 1
to 805
me 1041
they 5
would 5
not 85
try 12
to 805
part 102
us 70
if 8
he 962
were 5
so 797
they 5
could 2
not 85
succeed 4
by 57
supposing 1
such 2
an 970
affection 5
you 29
make 17
everybody 2
acting 2
unnaturally 1
and 51
wrong 24
and 51
me 1041
most 3
unhappy 1
do 814
not 85
distress 7
me 1041
by 57
the 193
idea 21
i 4330
am 392
not 85
ashamed 2
of 109
having 1
been 1
mistaken 2
or 333
at 272
least 3
it 67
is 124
light 42
it 67
is 124
nothing 5
in 2719
comparison 3
of 109
what 14
i 4330
should 7
feel 11
in 2719
thinking 2
ill 84
of 109
him 9
or 333
his 43
sisters 1
let 50
me 1041
take 18
it 67
in 2719
the 193
best 37
light 42
in 2719
the 193
light 42
in 2719
which 2
it 67
may 49
be 1200
understood 1
elizabeth 5
could 2
not 85
oppose 3
such 2
a 6799
wish 13
and 51
from 2
this 6
time 45
mr 5
name 17
was 93
scarcely 1
ever 33
mentioned 1
between 1
them 9
mrs 1
bennet 1
still 13
continued 1
to 805
wonder 17
and 51
repine 3
at 272
his 43
returning 1
no 896
more 11
and 51
though 12
a 6799
day 27
seldom 1
passed 1
in 2719
which 2
elizabeth 5
did 23
not 85
account 14
for 484
it 67
clearly 1
there 21
was 93
little 6
chance 20
of 109
her 181
ever 33
considering 1
it 67
with 34
less 19
perplexity 2
her 181
daughter 4
to 805
convince 3
her 181
of 109
what 14
she 199
did 23
not 85
believe 6
herself 1
that 11
his 43
attentions 1
to 805
jane 8
had 11
been 1
merely 1
the 193
effect 15
of 109
a 6799
common 23
and 51
transient 4
liking 2
which 2
ceased 1
when 6
he 962
saw 24
her 181
no 896
more 11
but 82
though 12
the 193
probability 2
of 109
the 193
statement 5
was 93
admitted 2
at 272
the 193
time 45
she 199
had 11
the 193
same 5
story 13
to 805
repeat 12
every 10
day 27
mrs 1
best 37
comfort 14
was 93
that 11
mr 5
must 28
be 1200
down 90
again 2
in 2719
the 193
summer 13
mr 5
bennet 1
treated 1
the 193
matter 7
differently 1
so 797
lizzy 2
said 1
he 962
one 19
day 27
your 4
sister 9
is 124
crossed 1
in 2719
love 29
i 4330
find 10
i 4330
congratulate 3
her 181
next 2
to 805
being 3
married 3
a 6799
girl 14
likes 2
to 805
be 1200
crossed 1
a 6799
little 6
in 2719
love 29
now 10
and 51
then 5
it 67
is 124
something 3
to 805
think 8
of 109
and 51
it 67
gives 1
her 181
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
distinction 3
among 1
her 181
companions 3
when 6
is 124
your 4
turn 46
to 805
come 36
you 29
will 39
hardly 1
bear 30
to 805
be 1200
long 49
outdone 1
by 57
jane 8
now 10
is 124
your 4
time 45
here 31
are 12
officers 1
enough 2
in 2719
to 805
disappoint 8
all 162
the 193
young 9
ladies 1
in 2719
the 193
country 12
let 50
be 1200
your 4
man 342
he 962
is 124
a 6799
pleasant 9
fellow 9
and 51
would 5
jilt 5
you 29
creditably 1
thank 15
you 29
sir 22
but 82
a 6799
less 19
agreeable 3
man 342
would 5
satisfy 3
me 1041
we 444
must 28
not 85
all 162
expect 20

it 67

of 109
material 17

in 2719
dispelling 1
the 193
gloom 8
which 2
the 193
late 23
perverse 4
occurrences 1
had 11
thrown 1
on 86
many 2
of 109

all 162
that 11

from 2

now 10
openly 1
acknowledged 1

the 193
only 1
creature 3
who 79
could 2
suppose 4
there 21
might 9
be 1200
any 17
extenuating 1
circumstances 1
in 2719
the 193
case 25
unknown 3

mild 14
and 51
steady 3
always 1
pleaded 1
for 484
allowances 1
and 51
urged 1
the 193
possibility 2
of 109
mistakes 1
but 82
by 57
everybody 2
else 2
mr 5
darcy 2
was 93
condemned 1
as 509
the 193
worst 6
of 109
men 140
chapter 3
after 48
a 6799
week 20
spent 1
in 2719
professions 1
of 109

was 93
called 1
from 2
his 43
amiable 1

by 57
the 193
arrival 3
of 109
saturday 3
the 193
pain 42
of 109
separation 3
however 1
might 9
be 1200
alleviated 1
on 86
his 43
side 74
by 57
preparations 1
for 484
the 193
reception 6
of 109
his 43
bride 9
as 509
he 962
had 11
reason 13
to 805
hope 16
that 11
shortly 1
after 48
his 43
return 14
into 26
the 193
day 27
would 5
be 1200
fixed 2
that 11
was 93
to 805
make 17
him 9
the 193
happiest 1
of 109
men 140
he 962
took 1
leave 14
of 109
his 43
relations 4
at 272
with 34

much 2
solemnity 2
as 509

wished 1
his 43
fair 25
cousins 1
health 12

happiness 2
again 2

on 86
the 193
following 3
monday 3
mrs 1

had 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
receiving 1
her 181
brother 9
and 51
his 43
wife 6
who 79
came 36
as 509
usual 3
to 805
spend 11
the 193
christmas 9
at 272
mr 5
was 93
a 6799
sensible 3
man 342
greatly 1
superior 5
to 805
his 43
sister 9
as 509
well 24
by 57
nature 3
as 509
education 9
the 193
ladies 1
would 5
have 11
had 11
difficulty 2
in 2719
believing 1
that 11
a 6799
man 342
who 79
lived 1
by 57
trade 20
and 51
within 3
view 18
of 109
his 43
own 9
warehouses 1
could 2
have 11
been 1
so 797
well 24
bred 1
and 51
agreeable 3
mrs 1
who 79
was 93
several 3
years 1
younger 1
than 22
mrs 1
bennet 1
and 51
mrs 1
phillips 1
was 93
an 970
amiable 1
intelligent 4
elegant 2
woman 21
and 51
a 6799
great 12
with 34
all 162
her 181
nieces 1
between 1
the 193
two 14
eldest 1
and 51
herself 1
especially 1
there 21
subsisted 1
a 6799
particular 13
regard 7
they 5
had 11
frequently 1
been 1
staying 1
with 34
her 181
in 2719
town 27
the 193
first 8
part 102
of 109
mrs 1
business 13
on 86
her 181
arrival 3
was 93
to 805
distribute 3
her 181
presents 1
and 51
describe 6
the 193
newest 1
fashions 1
when 6
this 6
was 93
done 3
she 199
had 11
a 6799
less 19
active 6
part 102
to 805
play 73
it 67
became 1
her 181
turn 46
to 805
listen 9
mrs 1
bennet 1
had 11
many 2
grievances 1
to 805
relate 8
and 51
much 2
to 805
complain 13
of 109
they 5
had 11
all 162
been 1
very 1
ill 84
used 1
since 7
she 199
last 7
saw 24
her 181
sister 9
two 14
of 109
her 181
girls 1
had 11
been 1
upon 1
the 193
point 22
of 109
marriage 6
and 51
after 48
all 162
there 21
was 93
nothing 5
in 2719
it 67
i 4330
do 814
not 85
blame 12
jane 8
she 199
continued 1
for 484
jane 8
would 5
have 11
got 14
mr 5
if 8
she 199
could 2
but 82
lizzy 2
oh 17
sister 9
it 67
is 124
very 1
hard 70
to 805
think 8
that 11
she 199
might 9
have 11
been 1
mr 5
wife 6
by 57
this 6
time 45
had 11
it 67
not 85
been 1
for 484
her 181
own 9
perverseness 2
he 962
made 13
her 181
an 970
offer 10
in 2719
this 6
very 1
room 22
and 51
she 199
refused 1
him 9
the 193
consequence 3
of 109
it 67
is 124
that 11
lady 18
lucas 1
will 39
have 11
a 6799
daughter 4
married 3
before 2
i 4330
have 11
and 51
that 11
the 193
estate 3
is 124
just 24
as 509
much 2
entailed 1
as 509
ever 33
the 193
are 12
very 1
artful 4
people 4
indeed 1
sister 9
they 5
are 12
all 162
for 484
what 14
they 5
can 287
get 13
i 4330
am 392
sorry 1
to 805
say 7
it 67
of 109
them 9
but 82
so 797
it 67
is 124
it 67
makes 4
me 1041
very 1
nervous 4
and 51
poorly 1
to 805
be 1200
thwarted 1
so 797
in 2719
my 90
own 9
family 2
and 51
to 805
have 11
who 79
think 8
of 109
themselves 1
before 2
anybody 2
else 2
however 1
your 4
coming 3
just 24
at 272
this 6
time 45
is 124
the 193
greatest 1
of 109
comforts 1
and 51
i 4330
am 392
very 1
glad 30
to 805
hear 76
what 14
you 29
tell 16
us 70
of 109
long 49
sleeves 1
mrs 1
to 805
whom 3
the 193
chief 14
of 109
this 6
news 71
had 11
been 1
given 3
before 2
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
jane 8
and 51
elizabeth's 1
correspondence 3
with 34
her 181
made 13
her 181
sister 9
a 6799
slight 10
answer 8
and 51
in 2719
compassion 4
to 805
her 181
nieces 1
turned 1
the 193
conversation 8
when 6
alone 1
with 34
elizabeth 5
afterwards 1
she 199
spoke 14
more 11
on 86
the 193
subject 11
it 67
seems 1
likely 1
to 805
have 11
been 1
a 6799
desirable 3
match 25
for 484
jane 8
said 1
she 199
i 4330
am 392
sorry 1
it 67
went 1
off 100
but 82
these 4
things 1
happen 9
so 797
often 4
a 6799
young 9
man 342
such 2
as 509
you 29
describe 6
mr 5
so 797
easily 1
falls 1
in 2719
love 29
with 34
a 6799
pretty 3
girl 14
for 484
a 6799
few 6
weeks 2
and 51
when 6
accident 7
separates 1
them 9
so 797
easily 1
forgets 1
her 181
that 11
these 4
sort 14
of 109
inconsistencies 1
are 12
very 1
frequent 9
an 970
excellent 2
consolation 3
in 2719
its 2
way 27
said 1
elizabeth 5
but 82
it 67
will 39
not 85
do 814
for 484
us 70
we 444
do 814
not 85
suffer 11
by 57
accident 7
it 67
does 5
not 85
often 4
happen 9
that 11
the 193
interference 2
of 109
friends 4
will 39
persuade 6
a 6799
young 9
man 342
of 109
independent 4
fortune 8
to 805
think 8
no 896
more 11
of 109
a 6799
girl 14
whom 3
he 962
was 93
violently 1
in 2719
love 29
with 34
only 1
a 6799
few 6
days 1
before 2
but 82
that 11
expression 11
of 109
in 2719
love' 1
is 124
so 797
hackneyed 1
so 797
doubtful 4
so 797
indefinite 4
that 11
it 67
gives 1
me 1041
very 1
little 6
idea 21
it 67
is 124
as 509
often 4
applied 1
to 805
feelings 1
which 2
arise 3
from 2
a 6799
half 23
hour's 1
acquaintance 5
as 509
to 805
a 6799
real 47
strong 16
attachment 3
pray 9
how 27
violent 2
was 93
mr 5
love 29
i 4330
never 3
saw 24
a 6799
more 11
promising 2
inclination 3
he 962
was 93
growing 1
quite 1
inattentive 4
to 805
other 5
people 4
and 51
wholly 1
engrossed 1
by 57
her 181
every 10
time 45
they 5
met 180
it 67
was 93
more 11
decided 2
and 51
remarkable 3
at 272
his 43
own 9
ball 77
he 962
offended 1
two 14
or 333
three 12
young 9
ladies 1
by 57
not 85
asking 1
them 9
to 805
dance 7
and 51
i 4330
spoke 14
to 805
him 9
twice 1
myself 1
without 1
receiving 1
an 970
answer 8
could 2
there 21
be 1200
finer 3
symptoms 1
is 124
not 85
general 22
incivility 2
the 193
very 1
essence 3
of 109
love 29
oh 17
yes 16
of 109
that 11
kind 31
of 109
love 29
which 2
i 4330
suppose 4
him 9
to 805
have 11
felt 5
poor 11
jane 8
i 4330
am 392
sorry 1
for 484
her 181
because 1
with 34
her 181
disposition 3
she 199
may 49
not 85
get 13
over 596
it 67
immediately 1
it 67
had 11
better 7
have 11
happened 1
to 805
you 29
lizzy 2
you 29
would 5
have 11
laughed 1
yourself 1
out 365
of 109
it 67
sooner 1
but 82
do 814
you 29
think 8
she 199
would 5
be 1200
prevailed 1
upon 1
to 805
go 500
back 182
with 34
us 70
change 21
of 109
scene 5
might 9
be 1200
of 109
service 13
and 51
perhaps 1
a 6799
little 6
relief 3
from 2
home 90
may 49
be 1200
as 509
useful 4
as 509
anything 3
elizabeth 5
was 93
exceedingly 1
pleased 1
with 34
this 6
proposal 3
and 51
felt 5
persuaded 1
of 109
her 181
sister's 1
ready 2
acquiescence 2
i 4330
hope 16
added 1
mrs 1
that 11
no 896
consideration 3
with 34
regard 7
to 805
this 6
young 9
man 342
will 39
influence 4
her 181
we 444
live 43
in 2719
so 797
different 11
a 6799
part 102
of 109
town 27
all 162
our 3
connections 1
are 12
so 797
different 11
and 51
as 509
you 29
well 24
know 12
we 444
go 500
out 365
so 797
little 6
that 11
it 67
is 124
very 1
improbable 1
that 11
they 5
should 7
meet 9
at 272
all 162
unless 1
he 962
really 1
comes 4
to 805
see 70
her 181
and 51
that 11
is 124
quite 1
impossible 2
for 484
he 962
is 124
now 10
in 2719
the 193
custody 2
of 109
his 43
friend 14
and 51
mr 5
darcy 2
would 5
no 896
more 11
suffer 11
him 9
to 805
call 57
on 86
jane 8
in 2719
such 2
a 6799
part 102
of 109
london 5
my 90
dear 15
aunt 6
how 27
could 2
you 29
think 8
of 109
it 67
mr 5
darcy 2
may 49
perhaps 1
have 11
heard 1
of 109
such 2
a 6799
place 29
as 509
street 15
but 82
he 962
would 5
hardly 1
think 8
a 6799
month's 1
ablution 3
enough 2
to 805
cleanse 6
him 9
from 2
its 2
impurities 1
were 5
he 962
once 2
to 805
enter 23
it 67
and 51
depend 17
upon 1
it 67
mr 5
never 3
stirs 1
without 1
him 9
so 797
much 2
the 193
better 7
i 4330
hope 16
they 5
will 39
not 85
meet 9
at 272
all 162
but 82
does 5
not 85
jane 8
correspond 11
with 34
his 43
sister 9
she 199
will 39
not 85
be 1200
able 3
to 805
help 23
calling 3
she 199
will 39
drop 22
the 193
acquaintance 5
entirely 1
but 82
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
the 193
certainty 2
in 2719
which 2
elizabeth 5
affected 2
to 805
place 29
this 6
point 22
as 509
well 24
as 509
the 193
still 13
more 11
interesting 2
one 19
of 109
being 3
withheld 1
from 2
seeing 2
jane 8
she 199
felt 5
a 6799
solicitude 2
on 86
the 193
subject 11
which 2
convinced 1
her 181
on 86
examination 3
that 11
she 199
did 23
not 85
consider 13
it 67
entirely 1
hopeless 4
it 67
was 93
possible 3
and 51
sometimes 1
she 199
thought 11
it 67
probable 3
that 11
his 43
affection 5
might 9
be 1200
reanimated 1
and 51
the 193
influence 4
of 109
his 43
friends 4
successfully 1
combated 1
by 57
the 193
more 11
natural 18
influence 4
of 109
attractions 1
miss 71
bennet 1
accepted 1
her 181
aunt's 1
invitation 6
with 34
pleasure 5
and 51
the 193
were 5
no 896
otherwise 1
in 2719
her 181
thoughts 1
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
than 22
as 509
she 199
hoped 1
by 57
not 85
living 5
in 2719
the 193
same 5
house 87
with 34
her 181
brother 9
she 199
might 9
occasionally 1
spend 11
a 6799
morning 3
with 34
her 181
without 1
any 17
danger 7
of 109
seeing 2
him 9
the 193
stayed 1
a 6799
week 20
at 272
and 51
what 14
with 34
the 193
the 193
and 51
the 193
officers 1
there 21
was 93
not 85
a 6799
day 27
without 1
its 2
engagement 3
mrs 1
bennet 1
had 11
so 797
carefully 1
provided 1
for 484
the 193
entertainment 3
of 109
her 181
brother 9
and 51
sister 9
that 11
they 5
did 23
not 85
once 2
sit 29
down 90
to 805
a 6799
family 2
dinner 9
when 6
the 193
engagement 3
was 93
for 484
home 90
some 30
of 109
the 193
officers 1
always 1
made 13
part 102
of 109
it 67
of 109
which 2
officers 1
mr 5
was 93
sure 11
to 805
be 1200
one 19
and 51
on 86
these 4
occasions 1
mrs 1
rendered 1
suspicious 2
by 57
elizabeth's 1
warm 23
commendation 3
narrowly 1
observed 1
them 9
both 8
without 1
supposing 1
them 9
from 2
what 14
she 199
saw 24
to 805
be 1200
very 1
seriously 1
in 2719
love 29
their 2
preference 3
of 109
each 1
other 5
was 93
plain 27
enough 2
to 805
make 17
her 181
a 6799
little 6
uneasy 1
and 51
she 199
resolved 1
to 805
speak 12
to 805
elizabeth 5
on 86
the 193
subject 11
before 2
she 199
left 19
and 51
represent 11
to 805
her 181
the 193
imprudence 2
of 109
encouraging 2
such 2
an 970
attachment 3
to 805
mrs 1
had 11
one 19
means 1
of 109
affording 1
pleasure 5
unconnected 1
with 34
his 43
general 22
powers 1
about 1
ten 151
or 333
a 6799
dozen 4
years 1
ago 15
before 2
her 181
marriage 6
she 199
had 11
spent 1
a 6799
considerable 1
time 45
in 2719
that 11
very 1
part 102
of 109
to 805
which 2
he 962
belonged 1
they 5
had 11
therefore 1
many 2
acquaintances 3
in 2719
common 23
and 51
though 12
had 11
been 1
little 6
there 21
since 7
the 193
death 19
of 109
darcy's 1
father 12
it 67
was 93
yet 4
in 2719
his 43
power 19
to 805
give 15
her 181
fresher 2
intelligence 2
of 109
her 181
former 3
friends 4
than 22
she 199
had 11
been 1
in 2719
the 193
way 27
of 109
procuring 1
mrs 1
had 11
seen 1
and 51
known 1
the 193
late 23
mr 5
darcy 2
by 57
character 16
perfectly 1
well 24
here 31
consequently 1
was 93
an 970
inexhaustible 1
subject 11
of 109
discourse 4
in 2719
comparing 1
her 181
recollection 3
of 109
with 34
the 193
minute 12
description 3
which 2
could 2
give 15
and 51
in 2719
bestowing 1
her 181
tribute 3
of 109
praise 7
on 86
the 193
character 16
of 109
its 2
late 23
possessor 3
she 199
was 93
delighting 1
both 8
him 9
and 51
herself 1
on 86
being 3
made 13
acquainted 1
with 34
the 193
present 20
mr 5
darcy's 1
treatment 3
of 109
him 9
she 199
tried 1
to 805
remember 4
some 30
of 109
that 11
gentleman's 1
reputed 2
disposition 3
when 6
quite 1
a 6799
lad 47
which 2
might 9
agree 11
with 34
it 67
and 51
was 93
confident 6
at 272
last 7
that 11
she 199
recollected 1
having 1
heard 1
mr 5
darcy 2
formerly 1
spoken 1
of 109
as 509
a 6799
very 1
proud 5
ill 84
boy 25
chapter 3
mrs 1
caution 6
to 805
elizabeth 5
was 93
punctually 1
and 51
kindly 1
given 3
on 86
the 193
first 8
opportunity 2
of 109
speaking 2
to 805
her 181
alone 1
after 48
honestly 1
telling 2
her 181
what 14
she 199
thought 11
she 199
thus 1
went 1
on 86
you 29
are 12
too 50
sensible 3
a 6799
girl 14
lizzy 2
to 805
fall 29
in 2719
love 29
merely 1
because 1
you 29
are 12
warned 1
against 1
it 67
and 51
therefore 1
i 4330
am 392
not 85
afraid 1
of 109
speaking 2
openly 1
seriously 1
i 4330
would 5
have 11
you 29
be 1200
on 86
your 4
guard 26
do 814
not 85
involve 6
yourself 1
or 333
to 805
involve 6
him 9
in 2719
an 970
affection 5
which 2
the 193
want 13
of 109
fortune 8
would 5
make 17
so 797
very 1
imprudent 2
i 4330
have 11
nothing 5
to 805
say 7
against 1
him 9
he 962
is 124
a 6799
most 3
interesting 2
young 9
man 342
and 51
if 8
he 962
had 11
the 193
fortune 8
he 962
ought 2
to 805
have 11
i 4330
should 7
think 8
you 29
could 2
not 85
do 814
better 7
but 82
as 509
it 67
is 124
you 29
must 28
not 85
let 50
your 4
fancy 5
run 50
away 1
with 34
you 29
you 29
have 11
sense 8
and 51
we 444
all 162
expect 20
you 29
to 805
use 18
it 67
your 4
father 12
would 5
depend 17
on 86
your 4
resolution 3
and 51
good 28
conduct 21
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
must 28
not 85
disappoint 8
your 4
father 12
my 90
dear 15
aunt 6
this 6
is 124
being 3
serious 4
indeed 1
yes 16
and 51
i 4330
hope 16
to 805
engage 6
you 29
to 805
be 1200
serious 4
likewise 1
well 24
then 5
you 29
need 29
not 85
be 1200
under 288
any 17
alarm 9
i 4330
will 39
take 18
care 47
of 109
myself 1
and 51
of 109
mr 5
too 50
he 962
shall 12
not 85
be 1200
in 2719
love 29
with 34
me 1041
if 8
i 4330
can 287
prevent 13
it 67
elizabeth 5
you 29
are 12
not 85
serious 4
now 10
i 4330
beg 59
your 4
pardon 10
i 4330
will 39
try 12
again 2
at 272
present 20
i 4330
am 392
not 85
in 2719
love 29
with 34
mr 5
no 896
i 4330
certainly 1
am 392
not 85
but 82
he 962
is 124
beyond 1
all 162
comparison 3
the 193
most 3
agreeable 3
man 342
i 4330
ever 33
saw 24
and 51
if 8
he 962
becomes 1
really 1
attached 1
to 805
me 1041
i 4330
believe 6
it 67
will 39
be 1200
better 7
that 11
he 962
should 7
not 85
i 4330
see 70
the 193
imprudence 2
of 109
it 67
oh 17
that 11
abominable 1
mr 5
darcy 2
my 90
father's 1
opinion 4
of 109
me 1041
does 5
me 1041
the 193
greatest 1
and 51
i 4330
should 7
be 1200
miserable 3
to 805
forfeit 8
it 67
my 90
father 12
however 1
is 124
partial 6
to 805
mr 5
in 2719
short 62
my 90
dear 15
aunt 6
i 4330
should 7
be 1200
very 1
sorry 1
to 805
be 1200
the 193
means 1
of 109
making 4
any 17
of 109
you 29
unhappy 1
but 82
since 7
we 444
see 70
every 10
day 27
that 11
where 21
there 21
is 124
affection 5
young 9
people 4
are 12
seldom 1
withheld 1
by 57
immediate 4
want 13
of 109
fortune 8
from 2
entering 1
into 26
engagements 1
with 34
each 1
other 5
how 27
can 287
i 4330
promise 4
to 805
be 1200
wiser 1
than 22
so 797
many 2
of 109
my 90
fellow 9
creatures 1
if 8
i 4330
am 392
tempted 1
or 333
how 27
am 392
i 4330
even 36
to 805
know 12
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
wisdom 2
to 805
resist 17
all 162
that 11
i 4330
can 287
promise 4
you 29
therefore 1
is 124
not 85
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
a 6799
hurry 3
i 4330
will 39
not 85
be 1200
in 2719
a 6799
hurry 3
to 805
believe 6
myself 1
his 43
first 8
object 26
when 6
i 4330
am 392
in 2719
company 2
with 34
him 9
i 4330
will 39
not 85
be 1200
wishing 1
in 2719
short 62
i 4330
will 39
do 814
my 90
best 37
perhaps 1
it 67
will 39
be 1200
as 509
well 24
if 8
you 29
discourage 6
his 43
coming 3
here 31
so 797
very 1
often 4
at 272
least 3
you 29
should 7
not 85
remind 7
your 4
mother 21
of 109
inviting 2
him 9
as 509
i 4330
did 23
the 193
other 5
day 27
said 1
elizabeth 5
with 34
a 6799
conscious 5
smile 7
very 1
true 9
it 67
will 39
be 1200
wise 17
in 2719
me 1041
to 805
refrain 5
from 2
that 11
but 82
do 814
not 85
imagine 3
that 11
he 962
is 124
always 1
here 31
so 797
often 4
it 67
is 124
on 86
your 4
account 14
that 11
he 962
has 41
been 1
so 797
frequently 1
invited 1
this 6
week 20
you 29
know 12
my 90
mother's 1
ideas 1
as 509
to 805
the 193
necessity 2
of 109
constant 7
company 2
for 484
her 181
friends 4
but 82
really 1
and 51
upon 1
my 90
i 4330
will 39
try 12
to 805
do 814
what 14
i 4330
think 8
to 805
be 1200
the 193
wisest 1
and 51
now 10
i 4330
hope 16
you 29
are 12
satisfied 1
her 181
aunt 6
assured 4
her 181
that 11
she 199
was 93
and 51
elizabeth 5
having 1
thanked 1
her 181
for 484
the 193
kindness 3
of 109
her 181
hints 1
they 5
parted 1
a 6799
wonderful 4
instance 4
of 109
advice 2
being 3
given 3
on 86
such 2
a 6799
point 22
without 1
being 3
resented 1
mr 5
collins 1
returned 1
into 26
soon 3
after 48
it 67
had 11
been 1
by 57
the 193
and 51
jane 8
but 82
as 509
he 962
took 1
up 194
his 43
abode 3
with 34
the 193
his 43
arrival 3
was 93
no 896
great 12
inconvenience 4
to 805
mrs 1
bennet 1
his 43
marriage 6
was 93
now 10
fast 29
approaching 1
and 51
she 199
was 93
at 272
length 14
so 797
far 91
resigned 2
as 509
to 805
think 8
it 67
inevitable 2
and 51
even 36
repeatedly 1
to 805
say 7
in 2719
an 970
ill 84
tone 12
that 11
she 199
wished 1
they 5
might 9
be 1200
happy 1
thursday 3
was 93
to 805
be 1200
the 193
wedding 3
day 27
and 51
on 86
wednesday 3
miss 71
lucas 1
paid 1
her 181
farewell 3
visit 14
and 51
when 6
she 199
rose 37
to 805
take 18
leave 14
elizabeth 5
ashamed 2
of 109
her 181
mother's 1
ungracious 2
and 51
reluctant 2
good 28
wishes 1
and 51
sincerely 1
affected 2
herself 1
accompanied 1
her 181
out 365
of 109
the 193
room 22
as 509
they 5
went 1
downstairs 2
together 3
charlotte 4
said 1
i 4330
shall 12
depend 17
on 86
hearing 3
from 2
you 29
very 1
often 4
eliza 7
that 11
you 29
certainly 1
shall 12
and 51
i 4330
have 11
another 1
to 805
ask 6
you 29
will 39
you 29
come 36
and 51
see 70
me 1041
we 444
shall 12
often 4
meet 9
i 4330
hope 16
in 2719
i 4330
am 392
not 85
likely 1
to 805
leave 14
kent 9
for 484
some 30
time 45
promise 4
me 1041
therefore 1
to 805
come 36
to 805
elizabeth 5
could 2
not 85
refuse 4
though 12
she 199
foresaw 1
little 6
pleasure 5
in 2719
the 193
visit 14
my 90
father 12
and 51
maria 12
are 12
coming 3
to 805
me 1041
in 2719
march 11
added 1
charlotte 4
and 51
i 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 39
consent 5
to 805
be 1200
of 109
the 193
party 3
indeed 1
eliza 7
you 29
will 39
be 1200
as 509
welcome 4
as 509
either 1
of 109
them 9
the 193
wedding 3
took 1
place 29
the 193
bride 9
and 51
bridegroom 3
set 40
off 100
for 484
kent 9
from 2
the 193
church 21
door 41
and 51
everybody 2
had 11
as 509
much 2
to 805
say 7
or 333
to 805
hear 76
on 86
the 193
subject 11
as 509
usual 3
elizabeth 5
soon 3
heard 1
from 2
her 181
friend 14
and 51
their 2
correspondence 3
was 93
as 509
regular 13
and 51
frequent 9
as 509
it 67
had 11
ever 33
been 1
that 11
it 67
should 7
be 1200
equally 1
unreserved 2
was 93
impossible 2
elizabeth 5
could 2
never 3
address 9
her 181
without 1
feeling 4
that 11
all 162
the 193
comfort 14
of 109
intimacy 2
was 93
over 596
and 51
though 12
determined 2
not 85
to 805
slacken 4
as 509
a 6799
correspondent 3
it 67
was 93
for 484
the 193
sake 2
of 109
what 14
had 11
been 1
rather 2
than 22
what 14
was 93
charlotte's 1
first 8
letters 1
were 5
received 1
with 34
a 6799
good 28
deal 13
of 109
eagerness 2
there 21
could 2
not 85
but 82
be 1200
curiosity 2
to 805
know 12
how 27
she 199
would 5
speak 12
of 109
her 181
new 115
home 90
how 27
she 199
would 5
like 22
lady 18
catherine 2
and 51
how 27
happy 1
she 199
would 5
dare 15
pronounce 7
herself 1
to 805
be 1200
though 12
when 6
the 193
letters 1
were 5
read 49
elizabeth 5
felt 5
that 11
charlotte 4
expressed 1
herself 1
on 86
every 10
point 22
exactly 1
as 509
she 199
might 9
have 11
foreseen 1
she 199
wrote 1
cheerfully 1
seemed 1
surrounded 1
with 34
comforts 1
and 51
mentioned 1
nothing 5
which 2
she 199
could 2
not 85
praise 7
the 193
house 87
furniture 2
and 51
roads 10
were 5
all 162
to 805
her 181
taste 15
and 51
lady 18
catherine's 1
was 93
most 3
friendly 2
and 51
obliging 2
it 67
was 93
mr 5
picture 8
of 109
and 51
rationally 1
softened 1
and 51
elizabeth 5
perceived 1
that 11
she 199
must 28
wait 19
for 484
her 181
own 9
visit 14
there 21
to 805
know 12
the 193
rest 110
jane 8
had 11
already 1
written 1
a 6799
few 6
lines 4
to 805
her 181
sister 9
to 805
announce 9
their 2
safe 20
arrival 3
in 2719
london 5
and 51
when 6
she 199
wrote 1
again 2
elizabeth 5
hoped 1
it 67
would 5
be 1200
in 2719
her 181
power 19
to 805
say 7
something 3
of 109
the 193
her 181
impatience 3
for 484
this 6
second 16
letter 20
was 93
as 509
well 24
rewarded 1
as 509
impatience 3
generally 1
is 124
jane 8
had 11
been 1
a 6799
week 20
in 2719
town 27
without 1
either 1
seeing 2
or 333
hearing 3
from 2
caroline 1
she 199
accounted 1
for 484
it 67
however 1
by 57
supposing 1
that 11
her 181
last 7
letter 20
to 805
her 181
friend 14
from 2
had 11
by 57
some 30
accident 7
been 1
lost 1
my 90
aunt 6
she 199
continued 1
is 124
going 3
to 805
morrow 3
into 26
that 11
part 102
of 109
the 193
town 27
and 51
i 4330
shall 12
take 18
the 193
opportunity 2
of 109
calling 3
in 2719
street 15
she 199
wrote 1
again 2
when 6
the 193
visit 14
was 93
paid 1
and 51
she 199
had 11
seen 1
miss 71
i 4330
did 23
not 85
think 8
caroline 1
in 2719
spirits 1
were 5
her 181
words 5
but 82
she 199
was 93
very 1
glad 30
to 805
see 70
me 1041
and 51
reproached 1
me 1041
for 484
giving 2
her 181
no 896
notice 8
of 109
my 90
coming 3
to 805
london 5
i 4330
was 93
right 31
therefore 1
my 90
last 7
letter 20
had 11
never 3
reached 1
her 181
i 4330
inquired 1
after 48
their 2
brother 9
of 109
course 10
he 962
was 93
well 24
but 82
so 797
much 2
engaged 1
with 34
mr 5
darcy 2
that 11
they 5
scarcely 1
ever 33
saw 24
him 9
i 4330
found 18
that 11
miss 71
darcy 2
was 93
expected 1
to 805
dinner 9
i 4330
wish 13
i 4330
could 2
see 70
her 181
my 90
visit 14
was 93
not 85
long 49
as 509
caroline 1
and 51
mrs 1
hurst 2
were 5
going 3
out 365
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
i 4330
shall 12
see 70
them 9
soon 3
here 31
elizabeth 5
shook 1
her 181
head 140
over 596
this 6
letter 20
it 67
convinced 1
her 181
that 11
accident 7
only 1
could 2
discover 10
to 805
mr 5
her 181
sister's 1
being 3
in 2719
town 27
four 26
weeks 2
passed 1
away 1
and 51
jane 8
saw 24
nothing 5
of 109
him 9
she 199
to 805
persuade 6
herself 1
that 11
she 199
did 23
not 85
regret 9
it 67
but 82
she 199
could 2
no 896
longer 1
be 1200
blind 22
to 805
miss 71
inattention 2
after 48
waiting 2
at 272
home 90
every 10
morning 3
for 484
a 6799
fortnight 4
and 51
inventing 1
every 10
evening 3
a 6799
fresh 22
excuse 4
for 484
her 181
the 193
visitor 3
did 23
at 272
last 7
appear 7
but 82
the 193
shortness 2
of 109
her 181
stay 7
and 51
yet 4
more 11
the 193
alteration 3
of 109
her 181
manner 8
would 5
allow 9
jane 8
to 805
deceive 6
herself 1
no 896
longer 1
the 193
letter 20
which 2
she 199
wrote 1
on 86
this 6
occasion 7
to 805
her 181
sister 9
will 39
prove 21
what 14
she 199
felt 5
my 90
dearest 2
lizzy 2
will 39
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
be 1200
incapable 1
of 109
triumphing 1
in 2719
her 181
better 7
at 272
my 90
expense 3
when 6
i 4330
confess 14
myself 1
to 805
have 11
been 1
entirely 1
deceived 1
in 2719
miss 71
regard 7
for 484
me 1041
but 82
my 90
dear 15
sister 9
though 12
the 193
event 18
has 41
proved 1
you 29
right 31
do 814
not 85
think 8
me 1041
obstinate 2
if 8
i 4330
still 13
assert 11
that 11
considering 1
what 14
her 181
was 93
my 90
confidence 3
was 93
as 509
natural 18
as 509
your 4
suspicion 3
i 4330
do 814
not 85
at 272
all 162
comprehend 4
her 181
reason 13
for 484
wishing 1
to 805
be 1200
intimate 5
with 34
me 1041
but 82
if 8
the 193
same 5
circumstances 1
were 5
to 805
happen 9
again 2
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
i 4330
should 7
be 1200
deceived 1
again 2
caroline 1
did 23
not 85
return 14
my 90
visit 14
till 14
yesterday 3
and 51
not 85
a 6799
note 16
not 85
a 6799
line 36
did 23
i 4330
receive 8
in 2719
the 193
meantime 2
when 6
she 199
did 23
come 36
it 67
was 93
very 1
evident 2
that 11
she 199
had 11
no 896
pleasure 5
in 2719
it 67
she 199
made 13
a 6799
slight 10
formal 21
apology 2
for 484
not 85
calling 3
before 2
said 1
not 85
a 6799
word 26
of 109
wishing 1
to 805
see 70
me 1041
again 2
and 51
was 93
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
so 797
altered 1
a 6799
creature 3
that 11
when 6
she 199
went 1
away 1
i 4330
was 93
perfectly 1
resolved 1
to 805
continue 3
the 193
acquaintance 5
no 896
longer 1
i 4330
pity 4
though 12
i 4330
cannot 1
help 23
blaming 1
her 181
she 199
was 93
very 1
wrong 24
in 2719
singling 1
me 1041
out 365
as 509
she 199
did 23
i 4330
can 287
safely 1
say 7
that 11
every 10
advance 7
to 805
intimacy 2
began 1
on 86
her 181
side 74
but 82
i 4330
pity 4
her 181
because 1
she 199
must 28
feel 11
that 11
she 199
has 41
been 1
acting 2
wrong 24
and 51
because 1
i 4330
am 392
very 1
sure 11
that 11
anxiety 2
for 484
her 181
brother 9
is 124
the 193
cause 14
of 109
it 67
i 4330
need 29
not 85
explain 5
myself 1
farther 2
and 51
though 12
we 444
know 12
this 6
anxiety 2
to 805
be 1200
quite 1
needless 4
yet 4
if 8
she 199
feels 1
it 67
it 67
will 39
easily 1
account 14
for 484
her 181
to 805
me 1041
and 51
so 797
deservedly 1
dear 15
as 509
he 962
is 124
to 805
his 43
sister 9
whatever 1
anxiety 2
she 199
must 28
feel 11
on 86
his 43
behalf 2
is 124
natural 18
and 51
amiable 1
i 4330
cannot 1
but 82
wonder 17
however 1
at 272
her 181
having 1
any 17
such 2
fears 2
now 10
because 1
if 8
he 962
had 11
at 272
all 162
cared 1
about 1
me 1041
we 444
must 28
have 11
met 180
long 49
ago 15
he 962
knows 1
of 109
my 90
being 3
in 2719
town 27
i 4330
am 392
certain 5
from 2
something 3
she 199
said 1
herself 1
and 51
yet 4
it 67
would 5
seem 10
by 57
her 181
manner 8
of 109
talking 1
as 509
if 8
she 199
wanted 1
to 805
persuade 6
herself 1
that 11
he 962
is 124
really 1
partial 6
to 805
miss 71
darcy 2
i 4330
cannot 1
understand 8
it 67
if 8
i 4330
were 5
not 85
afraid 1
of 109
judging 1
harshly 1
i 4330
should 7
be 1200
almost 1
tempted 1
to 805
say 7
that 11
there 21
is 124
a 6799
strong 16
appearance 3
of 109
duplicity 2
in 2719
all 162
this 6
but 82
i 4330
will 39
to 805
banish 6
every 10
painful 6
thought 11
and 51
think 8
only 1
of 109
what 14
will 39
make 17
me 1041
happy 1
your 4
affection 5
and 51
the 193
invariable 3
kindness 3
of 109
my 90
dear 15
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
let 50
me 1041
hear 76
from 2
you 29
very 1
soon 3
miss 71
said 1
something 3
of 109
his 43
never 3
returning 1
to 805
again 2
of 109
giving 2
up 194
the 193
house 87
but 82
not 85
with 34
any 17
certainty 2
we 444
had 11
better 7
not 85
mention 5
it 67
i 4330
am 392
extremely 1
glad 30
that 11
you 29
have 11
such 2
pleasant 9
accounts 1
from 2
our 3
friends 4
at 272
pray 9
go 500
to 805
see 70
them 9
with 34
sir 22
william 3
and 51
maria 12
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
will 39
be 1200
very 1
comfortable 3
there 21
yours 3
etc 10
this 6
letter 20
gave 4
elizabeth 5
some 30
pain 42
but 82
her 181
spirits 1
returned 1
as 509
she 199
considered 1
that 11
jane 8
would 5
no 896
longer 1
be 1200
duped 1
by 57
the 193
sister 9
at 272
least 3
all 162
expectation 3
from 2
the 193
brother 9
was 93
now 10
absolutely 1
over 596
she 199
would 5
not 85
even 36
wish 13
for 484
a 6799
renewal 3
of 109
his 43
attentions 1
his 43
character 16
sunk 4
on 86
every 10
review 8
of 109
it 67
and 51
as 509
a 6799
punishment 3
for 484
him 9
as 509
well 24
as 509
a 6799
possible 3
advantage 6
to 805
jane 8
she 199
seriously 1
hoped 1
he 962
might 9
really 1
soon 3
marry 2
mr 5
darcy's 1
sister 9
as 509
by 57
account 14
she 199
would 5
make 17
him 9
abundantly 1
regret 9
what 14
he 962
had 11
thrown 1
away 1
mrs 1
about 1
this 6
time 45
reminded 1
elizabeth 5
of 109
her 181
promise 4
concerning 1
that 11
gentleman 3
and 51
required 1
information 3
and 51
elizabeth 5
had 11
such 2
to 805
send 10
as 509
might 9
rather 2
give 15
contentment 2
to 805
her 181
aunt 6
than 22
to 805
herself 1
his 43
apparent 2
partiality 2
had 11
subsided 1
his 43
attentions 1
were 5
over 596
he 962
was 93
the 193
admirer 3
of 109
some 30
one 19
else 2
elizabeth 5
was 93
watchful 4
enough 2
to 805
see 70
it 67
all 162
but 82
she 199
could 2
see 70
it 67
and 51
write 5
of 109
it 67
without 1
material 17
pain 42
her 181
heart 57
had 11
been 1
but 82
slightly 1
touched 1
and 51
her 181
vanity 2
was 93
satisfied 1
with 34
believing 1
that 11
she 199
would 5
have 11
been 1
his 43
only 1
choice 5
had 11
fortune 8
permitted 1
it 67
the 193
sudden 4
acquisition 3
of 109
ten 151
thousand 7
pounds 1
was 93
the 193
most 3
remarkable 3
charm 14
of 109
the 193
young 9
lady 18
to 805
whom 3
he 962
was 93
now 10
rendering 3
himself 1
agreeable 3
but 82
elizabeth 5
less 19
clear 23
sighted 1
perhaps 1
in 2719
this 6
case 25
than 22
in 2719
charlotte's 1
did 23
not 85
quarrel 11
with 34
him 9
for 484
his 43
wish 13
of 109
independence 2
nothing 5
on 86
the 193
contrary 2
could 2
be 1200
more 11
natural 18
and 51
while 4
able 3
to 805
suppose 4
that 11
it 67
cost 32
him 9
a 6799
few 6
struggles 1
to 805
relinquish 6
her 181
she 199
was 93
ready 2
to 805
allow 9
it 67
a 6799
wise 17
and 51
desirable 3
measure 8
for 484
both 8
and 51
could 2
very 1
sincerely 1
wish 13
him 9
happy 1
all 162
this 6
was 93
acknowledged 1
to 805
mrs 1
and 51
after 48
relating 1
the 193
circumstances 1
she 199
thus 1
went 1
on 86
i 4330
am 392
now 10
convinced 1
my 90
dear 15
aunt 6
that 11
i 4330
have 11
never 3
been 1
much 2
in 2719
love 29
for 484
had 11
i 4330
really 1
experienced 1
that 11
pure 14
and 51
elevating 1
passion 9
i 4330
should 7
at 272
present 20
detest 8
his 43
very 1
name 17
and 51
wish 13
him 9
all 162
manner 8
of 109
evil 15
but 82
my 90
feelings 1
are 12
not 85
only 1
cordial 6
towards 1
him 9
they 5
are 12
even 36
impartial 4
towards 1
miss 71
king 23
i 4330
cannot 1
find 10
out 365
that 11
i 4330
hate 14
her 181
at 272
all 162
or 333
that 11
i 4330
am 392
in 2719
the 193
least 3
unwilling 4
to 805
think 8
her 181
a 6799
very 1
good 28
sort 14
of 109
girl 14
there 21
can 287
be 1200
no 896
love 29
in 2719
all 162
this 6
my 90
watchfulness 2
has 41
been 1
effectual 2
and 51
though 12
i 4330
certainly 1
should 7
be 1200
a 6799
more 11
interesting 2
object 26
to 805
all 162
my 90
acquaintances 3
were 5
i 4330
distractedly 1
in 2719
love 29
with 34
him 9
i 4330
cannot 1
say 7
that 11
i 4330
regret 9
my 90
comparative 4
insignificance 2
importance 2
may 49
sometimes 1
be 1200
purchased 1
too 50
dearly 1
kitty 2
and 51
lydia 4
take 18
his 43
defection 3
much 2
more 11
to 805
heart 57
than 22
i 4330
do 814
they 5
are 12
young 9
in 2719
the 193
ways 4
of 109
the 193
world 12
and 51
not 85
yet 4
open 21
to 805
the 193
mortifying 1
conviction 3
that 11
handsome 6
young 9
men 140
must 28
have 11
something 3
to 805
live 43
on 86
as 509
well 24
as 509
the 193
plain 27
chapter 3
with 34
no 896
greater 1
events 1
than 22
these 4
in 2719
the 193
family 2
and 51
otherwise 1
diversified 1
by 57
little 6
beyond 1
the 193
walks 1
to 805
sometimes 1
dirty 2
and 51
sometimes 1
cold 9
did 23
january 2
and 51
february 2
pass 66
away 1
march 11
was 93
to 805
take 18
elizabeth 5
to 805
she 199
had 11
not 85
at 272
first 8
thought 11
very 1
seriously 1
of 109
going 3
thither 1
but 82
charlotte 4
she 199
soon 3
found 18
was 93
depending 1
on 86
the 193
plan 61
and 51
she 199
gradually 1
learned 2
to 805
consider 13
it 67
herself 1
with 34
greater 1
pleasure 5
as 509
well 24
as 509
greater 1
certainty 2
absence 3
had 11
increased 1
her 181
desire 6
of 109
seeing 2
charlotte 4
again 2
and 51
weakened 1
her 181
disgust 7
of 109
mr 5
collins 1
there 21
was 93
novelty 2
in 2719
the 193
scheme 7
and 51
as 509
with 34
such 2
a 6799
mother 21
and 51
such 2
sisters 1
home 90
could 2
not 85
be 1200
faultless 4
a 6799
little 6
change 21
was 93
not 85
unwelcome 1
for 484
its 2
own 9
sake 2
the 193
journey 11
would 5
moreover 1
give 15
her 181
a 6799
peep 15
at 272
jane 8
and 51
in 2719
short 62
as 509
the 193
time 45
drew 2
near 15
she 199
would 5
have 11
been 1
very 1
sorry 1
for 484
any 17
delay 8
everything 2
however 1
went 1
on 86
smoothly 1
and 51

finally 1
settled 1
according 2
to 805
charlotte's 1
first 8
sketch 18
she 199
was 93
to 805
accompany 2
sir 22

and 51
his 43
second 16
daughter 4
the 193
improvement 3
of 109
spending 2
a 6799
night 61
in 2719
london 5
was 93
added 1
in 2719
time 45
and 51
the 193
plan 61
became 1
perfect 24
as 509
plan 61
could 2
be 1200
the 193
only 1
pain 42
was 93
in 2719
leaving 3
her 181
father 12
who 79
would 5
certainly 1
miss 71
her 181
and 51
who 79
when 6
it 67
came 36
to 805
the 193
point 22
so 797
little 6
liked 1
her 181
going 3
that 11
he 962
told 1
her 181
to 805
write 5
to 805
him 9
and 51
almost 1
promised 1
to 805
answer 8
her 181
letter 20
the 193
farewell 3
between 1
herself 1
and 51
mr 5
was 93
perfectly 1
friendly 2
on 86
his 43
side 74
even 36
more 11
his 43
present 20
pursuit 3
could 2
not 85
make 17
him 9
forget 8
that 11
elizabeth 5
had 11
been 1
the 193
first 8
to 805
excite 10
and 51
to 805
deserve 4
his 43
attention 3
the 193
first 8
to 805
listen 9
and 51
to 805
pity 4
the 193
first 8
to 805
be 1200
admired 1
and 51
in 2719
his 43
manner 8
of 109
bidding 2
her 181
adieu 3
wishing 1
her 181
every 10
enjoyment 3
reminding 1
her 181
of 109
what 14
she 199
was 93
to 805
expect 20
in 2719
lady 18
catherine 2
de 2452
and 51
trusting 2
their 2
opinion 4
of 109
her 181
their 2
opinion 4
of 109
everybody 2
would 5
always 1
coincide 9
there 21
was 93
a 6799
solicitude 2
an 970
interest 6
which 2
she 199
felt 5
must 28
ever 33
attach 10
her 181
to 805
him 9
with 34
a 6799
most 3
sincere 4
regard 7
and 51
she 199
parted 1
from 2
him 9
convinced 1
that 11
whether 1
married 3
or 333
single 15
he 962
must 28
always 1
be 1200
her 181
model 10
of 109
the 193
amiable 1
and 51
pleasing 3
her 181
fellow 9
the 193
next 2
day 27
were 5
not 85
of 109
a 6799
kind 31
to 805
make 17
her 181
think 8
him 9
less 19
agreeable 3
sir 22
william 3
lucas 1
and 51
his 43
daughter 4
maria 12
a 6799
good 28
girl 14
but 82
as 509
empty 3
headed 1
as 509
himself 1
had 11
nothing 5
to 805
say 7
that 11
could 2
be 1200
worth 15
hearing 3
and 51
were 5
listened 1
to 805
with 34
about 1
as 509
much 2
delight 8
as 509
the 193
rattle 17
of 109
the 193
chaise 3
elizabeth 5
loved 1
absurdities 1
but 82
she 199
had 11
known 1
sir 22
too 50
long 49
he 962
could 2
tell 16
her 181
nothing 5
new 115
of 109
the 193
wonders 1
of 109
his 43
presentation 3
and 51
knighthood 3
and 51
his 43
civilities 1
were 5
worn 1
out 365
like 22
his 43
information 3
it 67
was 93
a 6799
journey 11
of 109
only 1
twenty 2
four 26
miles 4
and 51
they 5
began 1
it 67
so 797
early 1
as 509
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
street 15
by 57
noon 8
as 509
they 5
drove 6
to 805
mr 5
door 41
jane 8
was 93
at 272
a 6799
drawing 3
room 22
window 12
watching 1
their 2
arrival 3
when 6
they 5
entered 1
the 193
passage 6
she 199
was 93
there 21
to 805
welcome 4
them 9
and 51
elizabeth 5
looking 1
earnestly 1
in 2719
her 181
face 19
was 93
pleased 1
to 805
see 70
it 67
healthful 4
and 51
lovely 2
as 509
ever 33
on 86
the 193
stairs 1
were 5
a 6799
troop 11
of 109
little 6
boys 4
and 51
girls 1
whose 1
eagerness 2
for 484
their 2
cousin's 1
appearance 3
would 5
not 85
allow 9
them 9
to 805
wait 19
in 2719
the 193
drawing 3
room 22
and 51
whose 1
shyness 2
as 509
they 5
had 11
not 85
seen 1
her 181
for 484
a 6799
twelvemonth 3
prevented 1
their 2
coming 3
lower 9
all 162
was 93
joy 36
and 51
kindness 3
the 193
day 27
passed 1
most 3
pleasantly 1
away 1
the 193
morning 3
in 2719
bustle 4
and 51
shopping 2
and 51
the 193
evening 3
at 272
one 19
of 109
the 193
elizabeth 5
then 5
contrived 1
to 805
sit 29
by 57
her 181
aunt 6
their 2
first 8
object 26
was 93
her 181
sister 9
and 51
she 199
was 93
more 11
grieved 1
than 22
astonished 1
to 805
hear 76
in 2719
reply 3
to 805
her 181
minute 12
inquiries 1
that 11
though 12
jane 8
always 1
struggled 1
to 805
support 10
her 181
spirits 1
there 21
were 5
periods 1
of 109
dejection 2
it 67
was 93
reasonable 3
however 1
to 805
hope 16
that 11
they 5
would 5
not 85
continue 3
long 49
mrs 1
gave 4
her 181
the 193
particulars 1
also 3
of 109
miss 71
visit 14
in 2719
street 15
and 51
repeated 2
conversations 1
occurring 1
at 272
different 11
times 10
between 1
jane 8
and 51
herself 1
which 2
proved 1
that 11
the 193
former 3
had 11
from 2
her 181
heart 57
given 3
up 194
the 193
acquaintance 5
mrs 1
then 5
rallied 1
her 181
niece 3
on 86
desertion 3
and 51
complimented 1
her 181
on 86
bearing 3
it 67
so 797
well 24
but 82
my 90
dear 15
elizabeth 5
she 199
added 1
what 14
sort 14
of 109
girl 14
is 124
miss 71
king 23
i 4330
should 7
be 1200
sorry 1
to 805
think 8
our 3
friend 14
mercenary 2
pray 9
my 90
dear 15
aunt 6
what 14
is 124
the 193
difference 3
in 2719
matrimonial 1
affairs 1
between 1
the 193
mercenary 2
and 51
the 193
prudent 5
motive 4
where 21
does 5
discretion 3
end 92
and 51
avarice 2
begin 8
last 7
christmas 9
you 29
were 5
afraid 1
of 109
his 43
marrying 1
me 1041
because 1
it 67
would 5
be 1200
imprudent 2
and 51
now 10
because 1
he 962
is 124
trying 2
to 805
get 13
a 6799
girl 14
with 34
only 1
ten 151
thousand 7
pounds 1
you 29
want 13
to 805
find 10
out 365
that 11
he 962
is 124
mercenary 2
if 8
you 29
will 39
only 1
tell 16
me 1041
what 14
sort 14
of 109
girl 14
miss 71
king 23
is 124
i 4330
shall 12
know 12
what 14
to 805
think 8
she 199
is 124
a 6799
very 1
good 28
kind 31
of 109
girl 14
i 4330
believe 6
i 4330
know 12
no 896
harm 41
of 109
her 181
but 82
he 962
paid 1
her 181
not 85
the 193
smallest 1
attention 3
till 14
her 181
grandfather's 1
death 19
made 13
her 181
mistress 3
of 109
this 6
fortune 8
no 896
why 4
should 7
he 962
if 8
it 67
were 5
not 85
allowable 1
for 484
him 9
to 805
gain 21
my 90
affections 1
because 1
i 4330
had 11
no 896
money 17
what 14
occasion 7
could 2
there 21
be 1200
for 484
making 4
love 29
to 805
a 6799
girl 14
whom 3
he 962
did 23
not 85
care 47
about 1
and 51
who 79
was 93
equally 1
poor 11
but 82
there 21
seems 1
an 970
indelicacy 2
in 2719
directing 1
his 43
attentions 1
towards 1
her 181
so 797
soon 3
after 48
this 6
event 18
a 6799
man 342
in 2719
distressed 1
circumstances 1
has 41
not 85
time 45
for 484
all 162
those 1
elegant 2
which 2
other 5
people 4
may 49
observe 6
if 8
she 199
does 5
not 85
object 26
to 805
it 67
why 4
should 7
we 444
her 181
not 85
objecting 1
does 5
not 85
justify 2
him 9
it 67
only 1
shows 5
her 181
being 3
deficient 1
in 2719
something 3
herself 1
sense 8
or 333
feeling 4
well 24
cried 1
elizabeth 5
have 11
it 67
as 509
you 29
choose 5
he 962
shall 12
be 1200
mercenary 2
and 51
she 199
shall 12
be 1200
foolish 4
no 896
lizzy 2
that 11
is 124
what 14
i 4330
do 814
not 85
choose 5
i 4330
should 7
be 1200
sorry 1
you 29
know 12
to 805
think 8
ill 84
of 109
a 6799
young 9
man 342
who 79
has 41
lived 1
so 797
long 49
in 2719
oh 17
if 8
that 11
is 124
all 162
i 4330
have 11
a 6799
very 1
poor 11
opinion 4
of 109
young 9
men 140
who 79
live 43
in 2719
and 51
their 2
intimate 5
friends 4
who 79
live 43
in 2719
are 12
not 85
much 2
better 7
i 4330
am 392
sick 38
of 109
them 9
all 162
thank 15
heaven 9
i 4330
am 392
going 3
to 805
morrow 3
where 21
i 4330
shall 12
find 10
a 6799
man 342
who 79
has 41
not 85
one 19
agreeable 3
quality 2
who 79
has 41
neither 1
manner 8
nor 102
sense 8
to 805
recommend 8
him 9
stupid 9
men 140
are 12
the 193
only 1
ones 2
worth 15
knowing 3
after 48
all 162
take 18
care 47
lizzy 2
that 11
speech 13
strongly 1
of 109
disappointment 3
before 2
they 5
were 5
separated 1
by 57
the 193
conclusion 3
of 109
the 193
play 73
she 199
had 11
the 193
unexpected 4
happiness 2
of 109
an 970
invitation 6
to 805
accompany 2
her 181
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
in 2719
a 6799
tour 23
of 109
pleasure 5
which 2
they 5
proposed 1
taking 4
in 2719
the 193
summer 13
we 444
have 11
not 85
determined 2
how 27
far 91
it 67
shall 12
carry 12
us 70
said 1
mrs 1
but 82
perhaps 1
to 805
the 193
lakes 2
no 896
scheme 7
could 2
have 11
been 1
more 11
agreeable 3
to 805
elizabeth 5
and 51
her 181
acceptance 3
of 109
the 193
invitation 6
was 93
most 3
ready 2
and 51
grateful 4
oh 17
my 90
dear 15
dear 15
aunt 6
she 199
rapturously 1
cried 1
what 14
delight 8
what 14
felicity 2
you 29
give 15
me 1041
fresh 22
life 44
and 51
adieu 3
to 805
disappointment 3
and 51
spleen 3
what 14
are 12
young 9
men 140
to 805
rocks 1
and 51
mountains 4
oh 17
what 14
hours 1
of 109
transport 11
we 444
shall 12
spend 11
and 51
when 6
we 444
do 814
return 14
it 67
shall 12
not 85
be 1200
like 22
other 5
without 1
being 3
able 3
to 805
give 15
one 19
accurate 4
idea 21
of 109
anything 3
we 444
will 39
know 12
where 21
we 444
have 11
gone 4
we 444
will 39
recollect 7
what 14
we 444
have 11
seen 1
lakes 2
mountains 4
and 51
rivers 4
shall 12
not 85
be 1200
jumbled 1
together 3
in 2719
our 3
imaginations 1
nor 102
when 6
we 444
attempt 5
to 805
describe 6
any 17
particular 13
scene 5
will 39
we 444
begin 8
quarreling 1
about 1
its 2
relative 4
situation 3
let 50
our 3
first 8
effusions 1
be 1200
less 19
insupportable 1
than 22
those 1
of 109
the 193
generality 2
of 109
chapter 3
every 10
object 26
in 2719
the 193
next 2
day's 1
journey 11
was 93
new 115
and 51
interesting 2
to 805
elizabeth 5
and 51
her 181
spirits 1
were 5
in 2719
a 6799
state 41
of 109
enjoyment 3
for 484
she 199
had 11
seen 1
her 181
sister 9
looking 1
so 797
well 24
as 509
to 805
banish 6
all 162
fear 14
for 484
her 181
health 12
and 51
the 193
prospect 13
of 109
her 181
northern 5
tour 23
was 93
a 6799
constant 7
source 4
of 109
delight 8
when 6
they 5
left 19
the 193
high 54
road 38
for 484
the 193
lane 3
to 805
every 10
eye 57
was 93
in 2719
search 12
of 109
the 193
parsonage 3
and 51
every 10
turning 3
expected 1
to 805
bring 6
it 67
in 2719
view 18
the 193
palings 1
of 109
park 18
was 93
their 2
boundary 2
on 86
one 19
side 74
elizabeth 5
smiled 1
at 272
the 193
recollection 3
of 109
all 162
that 11
she 199
had 11
heard 1
of 109
its 2
inhabitants 1
at 272
length 14
the 193
parsonage 3
was 93
discernible 1
the 193
garden 12
sloping 1
to 805
the 193
road 38
the 193
house 87
standing 3
in 2719
it 67
the 193
green 57
pales 8
and 51
the 193
laurel 3
hedge 17
everything 2
declared 1
they 5
were 5
arriving 1
mr 5
collins 1
and 51
charlotte 4
appeared 1
at 272
the 193
door 41
and 51
the 193
carriage 5
stopped 1
at 272
the 193
small 14
gate 25
which 2
led 11
by 57
a 6799
short 62
gravel 7
walk 25
to 805
the 193
house 87
the 193
nods 1
and 51
smiles 1
of 109
the 193
whole 26
party 3
in 2719
a 6799
moment 14
they 5
were 5
all 162
out 365
of 109
the 193
chaise 3
rejoicing 3
at 272
the 193
sight 17
of 109
each 1
other 5
mrs 1
collins 1
welcomed 1
her 181
friend 14
with 34
the 193
liveliest 1
pleasure 5
and 51
elizabeth 5
was 93
more 11
and 51
more 11
satisfied 1
with 34
coming 3
when 6
she 199
found 18
herself 1
so 797
affectionately 1
received 1
she 199
saw 24
instantly 1
that 11
her 181
cousin's 1
manners 1
were 5
not 85
altered 1
by 57
his 43
marriage 6
his 43
formal 21
civility 2
was 93
just 24
what 14
it 67
had 11
been 1
and 51
he 962
detained 1
her 181
some 30
minutes 2
at 272
the 193
gate 25
to 805
hear 76
and 51
satisfy 3
his 43
inquiries 1
after 48
all 162
her 181
family 2
they 5
were 5
then 5
with 34
no 896
other 5
delay 8
than 22
his 43
pointing 1
out 365
the 193
neatness 2
of 109
the 193
entrance 6
taken 1
into 26
the 193
house 87
and 51
as 509
soon 3
as 509
they 5
were 5
in 2719
the 193
he 962
welcomed 1
them 9
a 6799
second 16
time 45
with 34
ostentatious 2
formality 2
to 805
his 43
humble 9
abode 3
and 51
punctually 1
repeated 2
all 162
his 43
wife's 1
offers 1
of 109
refreshment 4
elizabeth 5
was 93
prepared 3
to 805
see 70
him 9
in 2719
his 43
glory 3
and 51
she 199
could 2
not 85
help 23
in 2719
fancying 1
that 11
in 2719
displaying 1
the 193
good 28
proportion 11
of 109
the 193
room 22
its 2
aspect 3
and 51
its 2
furniture 2
he 962
addressed 1
himself 1
particularly 1
to 805
her 181
as 509
if 8
wishing 1
to 805
make 17
her 181
feel 11
what 14
she 199
had 11
lost 1
in 2719
refusing 1
him 9
but 82
though 12
everything 2
seemed 1
neat 11
and 51
comfortable 3
she 199
was 93
not 85
able 3
to 805
gratify 3
him 9
by 57
any 17
sigh 22
of 109
repentance 2
and 51
rather 2
looked 1
with 34
wonder 17
at 272
her 181
friend 14
that 11
she 199
could 2
have 11
so 797
cheerful 6
an 970
air 129
with 34
such 2
a 6799
companion 10
when 6
mr 5
collins 1
said 1
anything 3
of 109
which 2
his 43
wife 6
might 9
reasonably 1
be 1200
ashamed 2
which 2
certainly 1
was 93
not 85
she 199
involuntarily 1
turned 1
her 181
eye 57
on 86
charlotte 4
once 2
or 333
twice 1
she 199
could 2
discern 9
a 6799
faint 11
blush 8
but 82
in 2719
general 22
charlotte 4
wisely 1
did 23
not 85
hear 76
after 48
sitting 3
long 49
enough 2
to 805
admire 6
every 10
article 4
of 109
furniture 2
in 2719
the 193
room 22
from 2
the 193
sideboard 3
to 805
the 193
fender 3
to 805
give 15
an 970
account 14
of 109
their 2
journey 11
and 51
of 109
all 162
that 11
had 11
happened 1
in 2719
london 5
mr 5
collins 1
invited 1
them 9
to 805
take 18
a 6799
stroll 8
in 2719
the 193
garden 12
which 2
was 93
large 11
and 51
well 24
laid 1
out 365
and 51
to 805
the 193
cultivation 2
of 109
which 2
he 962
attended 1
himself 1
to 805
work 87
in 2719
this 6
garden 12
was 93
one 19
of 109
his 43
most 3
respectable 1
pleasures 1
and 51
elizabeth 5
admired 1
the 193
command 21
of 109
countenance 4
with 34
which 2
charlotte 4
talked 1
of 109
the 193
healthfulness 2
of 109
the 193
exercise 7
and 51
owned 1
she 199
encouraged 1
it 67
as 509
much 2
as 509
possible 3
here 31
leading 2
the 193
way 27
through 4
every 10
walk 25
and 51
cross 74
walk 25
and 51
scarcely 1
allowing 1
them 9
an 970
interval 3
to 805
utter 10
the 193
praises 1
he 962
asked 1
for 484
every 10
view 18
was 93
pointed 2
out 365
with 34
a 6799
minuteness 2
which 2
left 19
beauty 2
entirely 1
behind 4
he 962
could 2
number 8
the 193
fields 3
in 2719
every 10
direction 5
and 51
could 2
tell 16
how 27
many 2
trees 1
there 21
were 5
in 2719
the 193
most 3
distant 2
clump 8
but 82
of 109
all 162
the 193
views 1
which 2
his 43
garden 12
or 333
which 2
the 193
country 12
or 333
kingdom 3
could 2
boast 12
none 32
were 5
to 805
be 1200
compared 1
with 34
the 193
prospect 13
of 109
afforded 1
by 57
an 970
opening 3
in 2719
the 193
trees 1
that 11
bordered 1
the 193
park 18
nearly 1
opposite 4
the 193
front 29
of 109
his 43
house 87
it 67
was 93
a 6799
handsome 6
modern 23
building 3
well 24
situated 1
on 86
rising 3
ground 36
from 2
his 43
garden 12
mr 5
collins 1
would 5
have 11
led 11
them 9
round 29
his 43
two 14
meadows 1
but 82
the 193
ladies 1
not 85
having 1
shoes 7
to 805
encounter 5
the 193
remains 1
of 109
a 6799
white 55
frost 19
turned 1
back 182
and 51
while 4
sir 22
william 3
accompanied 1
him 9
charlotte 4
took 1
her 181
sister 9
and 51
friend 14
over 596
the 193
house 87
extremely 1
well 24
pleased 1
probably 1
to 805
have 11
the 193
opportunity 2
of 109
showing 3
it 67
without 1
her 181
husband's 1
help 23
it 67
was 93
rather 2
small 14
but 82
well 24
built 1
and 51
convenient 2
and 51
everything 2
was 93
fitted 1
up 194
and 51
arranged 1
with 34
a 6799
neatness 2
and 51
consistency 2
of 109
which 2
elizabeth 5
gave 4
charlotte 4
all 162
the 193
credit 12
when 6
mr 5
collins 1
could 2
be 1200
forgotten 1
there 21
was 93
really 1
an 970
air 129
of 109
great 12
comfort 14
throughout 1
and 51
by 57
charlotte's 1
evident 2
enjoyment 3
of 109
it 67
elizabeth 5
supposed 2
he 962
must 28
be 1200
often 4
forgotten 1
she 199
had 11
already 1
that 11
lady 18
catherine 2
was 93
still 13
in 2719
the 193
country 12
it 67
was 93
spoken 1
of 109
again 2
while 4
they 5
were 5
at 272
dinner 9
when 6
mr 5
collins 1
joining 1
in 2719
observed 1
yes 16
miss 71
elizabeth 5
you 29
will 39
have 11
the 193
of 109
seeing 2
lady 18
catherine 2
de 2452
on 86
the 193
ensuing 1
sunday 3
at 272
church 21
and 51
i 4330
need 29
not 85
say 7
you 29
will 39
be 1200
delighted 2
with 34
her 181
she 199
is 124
all 162
affability 2
and 51
condescension 2
and 51
i 4330
doubt 15
not 85
but 82
you 29
will 39
be 1200
with 34
some 30
portion 5
of 109
her 181
notice 8
when 6
service 13
is 124
over 596
i 4330
have 11
scarcely 1
any 17
hesitation 3
in 2719
saying 3
she 199
will 39
include 3
you 29
and 51
my 90
sister 9
maria 12
in 2719
every 10
invitation 6
with 34
which 2
she 199
us 70
during 1
your 4
stay 7
here 31
her 181
to 805
my 90
dear 15
charlotte 4
is 124
charming 2
we 444
dine 9
at 272
twice 1
every 10
week 20
and 51
are 12
never 3
allowed 1
to 805
walk 25
home 90
her 181
ladyship's 1
carriage 5
is 124
regularly 1
ordered 1
for 484
us 70
i 4330
should 7
say 7
one 19
of 109
her 181
ladyship's 1
carriages 1
for 484
she 199
has 41
several 3
lady 18
catherine 2
is 124
a 6799
very 1
respectable 1
sensible 3
woman 21
indeed 1
added 1
charlotte 4
and 51
a 6799
most 3
attentive 4
very 1
true 9
my 90
dear 15
that 11
is 124
exactly 1
what 14
i 4330
say 7
she 199
is 124
the 193
sort 14
of 109
woman 21
whom 3
one 19
cannot 1
regard 7
with 34
too 50
much 2
deference 2
the 193
evening 3
was 93
spent 1
chiefly 1
in 2719
talking 1
over 596
news 71
and 51
telling 2
again 2
what 14
had 11
already 1
been 1
written 1
and 51
when 6
it 67
closed 1
elizabeth 5
in 2719
the 193
solitude 2
of 109
her 181
chamber 10
had 11
to 805
meditate 3
upon 1
charlotte's 1
degree 3
of 109
contentment 2
to 805
understand 8
her 181
address 9
in 2719
guiding 1
and 51
composure 2
in 2719
bearing 3
with 34
her 181
husband 10
and 51
to 805
acknowledge 3
that 11
it 67
was 93
all 162
done 3
very 1
well 24
she 199
had 11
also 3
to 805
anticipate 3
how 27
her 181
visit 14
would 5
pass 66
the 193
quiet 20
tenor 3
of 109
their 2
usual 3
employments 1
the 193
vexatious 2
interruptions 1
of 109
mr 5
collins 1
and 51
the 193
of 109
their 2
intercourse 2
with 34
a 6799
lively 1
imagination 3
soon 3
settled 1
it 67
all 162
about 1
the 193
middle 14
of 109
the 193
next 2
day 27
as 509
she 199
was 93
in 2719
her 181
room 22
getting 1
ready 2
for 484
a 6799
walk 25
a 6799
sudden 4
noise 11
below 1
seemed 1
to 805
speak 12
the 193
whole 26
house 87
in 2719
confusion 3
and 51
after 48
listening 1
a 6799
moment 14
she 199
heard 1
somebody 2
running 2
up 194
stairs 1
in 2719
a 6799
violent 2
hurry 3
and 51
calling 3
loudly 1
after 48
her 181
she 199
opened 1
the 193
door 41
and 51
met 180
maria 12
in 2719
the 193
landing 3
place 29
who 79
breathless 4
with 34
agitation 3
cried 1
out 365
oh 17
my 90
dear 15
eliza 7
pray 9
make 17
haste 8
and 51
come 36
into 26
the 193
dining 1
room 22
for 484
there 21
is 124
such 2
a 6799
sight 17
to 805
be 1200
seen 1
i 4330
will 39
not 85
tell 16
you 29
what 14
it 67
is 124
make 17
haste 8
and 51
come 36
down 90
this 6
moment 14
elizabeth 5
asked 1
questions 1
in 2719
vain 8
maria 12
would 5
tell 16
her 181
nothing 5
more 11
and 51
down 90
they 5
ran 110
into 26
the 193
dining 1
room 22
which 2
fronted 1
the 193
lane 3
in 2719
quest 21
of 109
this 6
wonder 17
it 67
was 93
two 14
ladies 1
stopping 1
in 2719
a 6799
low 46
phaeton 3
at 272
the 193
garden 12
gate 25
and 51
is 124
this 6
all 162
cried 1
elizabeth 5
i 4330
expected 1
at 272
least 3
that 11
the 193
pigs 8
were 5
got 14
into 26
the 193
garden 12
and 51
here 31
is 124
nothing 5
but 82
lady 18
catherine 2
and 51
her 181
daughter 4
la 977
my 90
dear 15
said 1
maria 12
quite 1
shocked 1
at 272
the 193
mistake 5
it 67
is 124
not 85
lady 18
catherine 2
the 193
old 21
lady 18
is 124
mrs 1
who 79
lives 4
with 34
them 9
the 193
other 5
is 124
miss 71
de 2452
only 1
look 14
at 272
her 181
she 199
is 124
quite 1
a 6799
little 6
creature 3
who 79
would 5
have 11
thought 11
that 11
she 199
could 2
be 1200
so 797
thin 35
and 51
small 14
she 199
is 124
abominably 1
rude 6
to 805
keep 11
charlotte 4
out 365
of 109
doors 9
in 2719
all 162
this 6
wind 101
why 4
does 5
she 199
not 85
come 36
in 2719
oh 17
charlotte 4
says 1
she 199
hardly 1
ever 33
does 5
it 67
is 124
the 193
greatest 1
of 109
when 6
miss 71
de 2452
comes 4
in 2719
i 4330
like 22
her 181
appearance 3
said 1
elizabeth 5
struck 1
with 34
other 5
ideas 1
she 199
looks 1
sickly 1
and 51
cross 74
yes 16
she 199
will 39
do 814
for 484
him 9
very 1
well 24
she 199
will 39
make 17
him 9
a 6799
very 1
proper 9
wife 6
mr 5
collins 1
and 51
charlotte 4
were 5
both 8
standing 3
at 272
the 193
gate 25
in 2719
conversation 8
with 34
the 193
ladies 1
and 51
sir 22
william 3
to 805
elizabeth's 1
high 54
diversion 4
was 93
stationed 1
in 2719
the 193
doorway 3
in 2719
earnest 8
contemplation 2
of 109
the 193
greatness 2
before 2
him 9
and 51
constantly 1
bowing 1
whenever 1
miss 71
de 2452
looked 1
that 11
way 27
at 272
length 14
there 21
was 93
nothing 5
more 11
to 805
be 1200
said 1
the 193
ladies 1
drove 6
on 86
and 51
the 193
others 1
returned 1
into 26
the 193
house 87
mr 5
collins 1
no 896
sooner 1
saw 24
the 193
two 14
girls 1
than 22
he 962
began 1
to 805
congratulate 3
them 9
on 86
their 2
good 28
fortune 8
which 2
charlotte 4
explained 1
by 57
letting 2
them 9
know 12
that 11
the 193
whole 26
party 3
was 93
asked 1
to 805
dine 9
at 272
the 193
next 2
day 27
chapter 3
mr 5
triumph 10
in 2719
consequence 3
of 109
this 6
invitation 6
was 93
complete 8
the 193
power 19
of 109
displaying 1
the 193
grandeur 2
of 109
his 43
patroness 3
to 805
his 43
wondering 2
visitors 1
and 51
of 109
letting 2
them 9
see 70
her 181
civility 2
towards 1
himself 1
and 51
his 43
wife 6
was 93
exactly 1
what 14
he 962
had 11
wished 1
for 484
and 51
that 11
an 970
opportunity 2
of 109
doing 3
it 67
should 7
be 1200
given 3
so 797
soon 3
was 93
such 2
an 970
instance 4
of 109
lady 18
catherine's 1
condescension 2
as 509
he 962
knew 1
not 85
how 27
to 805
admire 6
enough 2
i 4330
confess 14
said 1
he 962
that 11
i 4330
should 7
not 85
have 11
been 1
at 272
all 162
surprised 1
by 57
her 181
ladyship's 1
asking 1
us 70
on 86
sunday 3
to 805
drink 9
tea 99
and 51
spend 11
the 193
evening 3
at 272
i 4330
rather 2
expected 1
from 2
my 90
knowledge 4
of 109
her 181
affability 2
that 11
it 67
would 5
happen 9
but 82
who 79
could 2
have 11
foreseen 1
such 2
an 970
attention 3
as 509
this 6
who 79
could 2
have 11
imagined 1
that 11
we 444
should 7
receive 8
an 970
invitation 6
to 805
dine 9
there 21
an 970
invitation 6
moreover 1
including 1
the 193
whole 26
party 3
so 797
immediately 1
after 48
your 4
arrival 3
i 4330
am 392
the 193
less 19
surprised 1
at 272
what 14
has 41
happened 1
replied 1
sir 22
william 3
from 2
that 11
knowledge 4
of 109
what 14
the 193
manners 1
of 109
the 193
great 12
really 1
are 12
which 2
my 90
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
has 41
allowed 1
me 1041
to 805
acquire 7
about 1
the 193
court 37
such 2
instances 1
of 109
elegant 2
breeding 2
are 12
not 85
uncommon 6
scarcely 1
anything 3
was 93
talked 1
of 109
the 193
whole 26
day 27
or 333
next 2
morning 3
but 82
their 2
visit 14
to 805
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
carefully 1
instructing 1
them 9
in 2719
what 14
they 5
were 5
to 805
expect 20
that 11
the 193
sight 17
of 109
such 2
rooms 1
so 797
many 2
servants 1
and 51
so 797
splendid 4
a 6799
dinner 9
might 9
not 85
wholly 1
overpower 5
them 9
when 6
the 193
ladies 1
were 5
separating 1
for 484
the 193
toilette 2
he 962
said 1
to 805
elizabeth 5
do 814
not 85
make 17
yourself 1
uneasy 1
my 90
dear 15
cousin 3
about 1
your 4
apparel 5
lady 18
catherine 2
is 124
far 91
from 2
requiring 1
that 11
elegance 2
of 109
dress 22
in 2719
us 70
which 2
becomes 1
herself 1
and 51
her 181
daughter 4
i 4330
would 5
advise 9
you 29
merely 1
to 805
put 47
on 86
whatever 1
of 109
your 4
clothes 10
is 124
superior 5
to 805
the 193
rest 110
there 21
is 124
no 896
occasion 7
for 484
anything 3
more 11
lady 18
catherine 2
will 39
not 85
think 8
the 193
worse 6
of 109
you 29
for 484
being 3
simply 1
dressed 1
she 199
likes 2
to 805
have 11
the 193
distinction 3
of 109
rank 19
preserved 1
while 4
they 5
were 5
dressing 3
he 962
came 36
two 14
or 333
three 12
times 10
to 805
their 2
different 11
doors 9
to 805
recommend 8
their 2
being 3
quick 25
as 509
lady 18
catherine 2
very 1
much 2
objected 1
to 805
be 1200
kept 1
waiting 2
for 484
her 181
dinner 9
such 2
formidable 1
accounts 1
of 109
her 181
ladyship 3
and 51
her 181
manner 8
of 109
living 5
quite 1
frightened 1
maria 12
lucas 1
who 79
had 11
been 1
little 6
used 1
to 805
company 2
and 51
she 199
looked 1
forward 12
to 805
her 181
introduction 3
at 272
with 34
as 509
much 2
apprehension 3
as 509
her 181
father 12
had 11
done 3
to 805
his 43
presentation 3
at 272
st 1910
james's 1
as 509
the 193
weather 33
was 93
fine 17
they 5
had 11
a 6799
pleasant 9
walk 25
of 109
about 1
half 23
a 6799
mile 15
across 1
the 193
park 18
every 10
park 18
has 41
its 2
beauty 2
and 51
its 2
prospects 1
and 51
elizabeth 5
saw 24
much 2
to 805
be 1200
pleased 1
with 34
though 12
she 199
could 2
not 85
be 1200
in 2719
such 2
raptures 1
as 509
mr 5
collins 1
expected 1
the 193
scene 5
to 805
inspire 3
and 51
was 93
but 82
slightly 1
affected 2
by 57
his 43
enumeration 3
of 109
the 193
windows 4
in 2719
front 29
of 109
the 193
house 87
and 51
his 43
relation 7
of 109
what 14
the 193
glazing 2
altogether 1
had 11
originally 1
cost 32
sir 22
lewis 1
de 2452
when 6
they 5
ascended 1
the 193
steps 7
to 805
the 193
hall 45
maria's 1
alarm 9
was 93
every 10
moment 14
increasing 2
and 51
even 36
sir 22
william 3
did 23
not 85
look 14
perfectly 1
calm 10
elizabeth's 1
courage 6
did 23
not 85
fail 12
her 181
she 199
had 11
heard 1
nothing 5
of 109
lady 18
catherine 2
that 11
spoke 14
her 181
awful 6
from 2
any 17
extraordinary 1
talents 1
or 333
miraculous 2
virtue 3
and 51
the 193
mere 10
stateliness 2
of 109
money 17
or 333
rank 19
she 199
thought 11
she 199
could 2
witness 5
without 1
trepidation 2
from 2
the 193
entrance 6
hall 45
of 109
which 2
mr 5
collins 1
pointed 2
out 365
with 34
a 6799
rapturous 2
air 129
the 193
fine 17
proportion 11
and 51
the 193
finished 1
ornaments 1
they 5
followed 1
the 193
servants 1
through 4
an 970
ante 34
chamber 10
to 805
the 193
room 22
where 21
lady 18
catherine 2
her 181
daughter 4
and 51
mrs 1
were 5
sitting 3
her 181
ladyship 3
with 34
great 12
condescension 2
arose 1
to 805
receive 8
them 9
and 51
as 509
mrs 1
collins 1
had 11
settled 1
it 67
with 34
her 181
husband 10
that 11
the 193
office 11
of 109
introduction 3
should 7
be 1200
hers 9
it 67
was 93
performed 1
in 2719
a 6799
proper 9
manner 8
without 1
any 17
of 109
those 1
apologies 1
and 51
thanks 4
which 2
he 962
would 5
have 11
thought 11
necessary 2
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
having 1
been 1
at 272
st 1910
james's 1
sir 22
william 3
was 93
so 797
completely 1
awed 1
by 57
the 193
grandeur 2
surrounding 4
him 9
that 11
he 962
had 11
but 82
just 24
courage 6
enough 2
to 805
make 17
a 6799
very 1
low 46
bow 58
and 51
take 18
his 43
seat 12
without 1
saying 3
a 6799
word 26
and 51
his 43
daughter 4
frightened 1
almost 1
out 365
of 109
her 181
senses 1
sat 92
on 86
the 193
edge 8
of 109
her 181
chair 20
not 85
knowing 3
which 2
way 27
to 805
look 14
elizabeth 5
found 18
herself 1
quite 1
equal 17
to 805
the 193
scene 5
and 51
could 2
observe 6
the 193
three 12
ladies 1
before 2
her 181
composedly 1
lady 18
catherine 2
was 93
a 6799
tall 35
large 11
woman 21
with 34
strongly 1
marked 2
features 1
which 2
might 9
once 2
have 11
been 1
handsome 6
her 181
air 129
was 93
not 85
conciliating 1
nor 102
was 93
her 181
manner 8
of 109
receiving 1
them 9
such 2
as 509
to 805
make 17
her 181
visitors 1
forget 8
their 2
inferior 5
rank 19
she 199
was 93
not 85
rendered 1
formidable 1
by 57
silence 7
but 82
whatever 1
she 199
said 1
was 93
spoken 1
in 2719
so 797
authoritative 4
a 6799
tone 12
as 509
marked 2
her 181
self 11
importance 2
and 51
brought 1
mr 5
immediately 1
to 805
elizabeth's 1
mind 25
and 51
from 2
the 193
observation 4
of 109
the 193
day 27
altogether 1
she 199
believed 1
lady 18
catherine 2
to 805
be 1200
exactly 1
what 14
he 962
represented 1
when 6
after 48
examining 1
the 193
mother 21
in 2719
whose 1
countenance 4
and 51
deportment 2
she 199
soon 3
found 18
some 30
resemblance 3
of 109
mr 5
darcy 2
she 199
turned 1
her 181
eyes 8
on 86
the 193
daughter 4
she 199
could 2
almost 1
have 11
joined 1
in 2719
maria's 1
astonishment 2
at 272
her 181
being 3
so 797
thin 35
and 51
so 797
small 14
there 21
was 93
neither 1
in 2719
figure 7
nor 102
face 19
any 17
likeness 3
between 1
the 193
ladies 1
miss 71
de 2452
was 93
pale 41
and 51
sickly 1
her 181
features 1
though 12
not 85
plain 27
were 5
insignificant 2
and 51
she 199
spoke 14
very 1
little 6
except 10
in 2719
a 6799
low 46
voice 8
to 805
mrs 1
in 2719
whose 1
appearance 3
there 21
was 93
nothing 5
remarkable 3
and 51
who 79
was 93
entirely 1
engaged 1
in 2719
listening 1
to 805
what 14
she 199
said 1
and 51
placing 2
a 6799
screen 15
in 2719
the 193
proper 9
direction 5
before 2
her 181
eyes 8
after 48
sitting 3
a 6799
few 6
minutes 2
they 5
were 5
all 162
sent 35
to 805
one 19
of 109
the 193
windows 4
to 805
admire 6
the 193
view 18
mr 5
collins 1
attending 1
them 9
to 805
point 22
out 365
its 2
beauties 1
and 51
lady 18
catherine 2
kindly 1
informing 1
them 9
that 11
it 67
was 93
much 2
better 7
worth 15
looking 1
at 272
in 2719
the 193
summer 13
the 193
dinner 9
was 93
exceedingly 1
handsome 6
and 51
there 21
were 5
all 162
the 193
servants 1
and 51
all 162
the 193
articles 1
of 109
plate 18
which 2
mr 5
collins 1
had 11
promised 1
and 51
as 509
he 962
had 11
likewise 1
foretold 1
he 962
took 1
his 43
seat 12
at 272
the 193
bottom 6
of 109
the 193
table 27
by 57
her 181
ladyship's 1
desire 6
and 51
looked 1
as 509
if 8
he 962
felt 5
that 11
life 44
could 2
furnish 6
nothing 5
greater 1
he 962
carved 1
and 51
ate 4
and 51
praised 1
with 34
delighted 2
alacrity 2
and 51
every 10
dish 52
was 93
commended 1
first 8
by 57
him 9
and 51
then 5
by 57
sir 22
william 3
who 79
was 93
now 10
enough 2
recovered 1
to 805
echo 9
whatever 1
his 43
son 70
in 2719
law 45
said 1
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
which 2
elizabeth 5
wondered 1
lady 18
catherine 2
could 2
bear 30
but 82
lady 18
catherine 2
seemed 1
gratified 1
by 57
their 2
excessive 2
admiration 2
and 51
gave 4
most 3
gracious 4
smiles 1
especially 1
when 6
any 17
dish 52
on 86
the 193
table 27
proved 1
a 6799
novelty 2
to 805
them 9
the 193
party 3
did 23
not 85
supply 3
much 2
conversation 8
elizabeth 5
was 93
ready 2
to 805
speak 12
whenever 1
there 21
was 93
an 970
opening 3
but 82
she 199
was 93
seated 1
between 1
charlotte 4
and 51
miss 71
de 2452
the 193
former 3
of 109
whom 3
was 93
engaged 1
in 2719
listening 1
to 805
lady 18
catherine 2
and 51
the 193
latter 3
said 1
not 85
a 6799
word 26
to 805
her 181
all 162
dinner 9
time 45
mrs 1
was 93
chiefly 1
employed 1
in 2719
watching 1
how 27
little 6
miss 71
de 2452
ate 4
pressing 4
her 181
to 805
try 12
some 30
other 5
dish 52
and 51
fearing 1
she 199
was 93
indisposed 1
maria 12
thought 11
speaking 2
out 365
of 109
the 193
question 16
and 51
the 193
gentlemen 1
did 23
nothing 5
but 82
eat 15
and 51
admire 6
when 6
the 193
ladies 1
returned 1
to 805
the 193
drawing 3
room 22
there 21
was 93
little 6
to 805
be 1200
done 3
but 82
to 805
hear 76
lady 18
catherine 2
talk 18
which 2
she 199
did 23
without 1
any 17
intermission 3
till 14
coffee 15
came 36
in 2719
delivering 1
her 181
opinion 4
on 86
every 10
subject 11
in 2719
so 797
decisive 4
a 6799
manner 8
as 509
proved 1
that 11
she 199
was 93
not 85
used 1
to 805
have 11
her 181
controverted 1
she 199
inquired 1
into 26
charlotte's 1
domestic 12
concerns 1
familiarly 1
and 51
minutely 1
gave 4
her 181
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
advice 2
as 509
to 805
the 193
management 3
of 109
them 9
all 162
told 1
her 181
how 27
everything 2
ought 2
to 805
be 1200
regulated 1
in 2719
so 797
small 14
a 6799
family 2
as 509
hers 9
and 51
instructed 1
her 181
as 509
to 805
the 193
care 47
of 109
her 181
cows 6
and 51
her 181
poultry 2
elizabeth 5
found 18
that 11
nothing 5
was 93
beneath 1
this 6
great 12
lady's 1
attention 3
which 2
could 2
furnish 6
her 181
with 34
an 970
occasion 7
of 109
dictating 1
to 805
others 1
in 2719
the 193
intervals 1
of 109
her 181
discourse 4
with 34
mrs 1
collins 1
she 199
addressed 1
a 6799
variety 2
of 109
questions 1
to 805
maria 12
and 51
elizabeth 5
but 82
especially 1
to 805
the 193
latter 3
of 109
whose 1
connections 1
she 199
knew 1
the 193
least 3
and 51
who 79
she 199
observed 1
to 805
mrs 1
collins 1
was 93
a 6799
very 1
genteel 4
pretty 3
kind 31
of 109
girl 14
she 199
asked 1
her 181
at 272
different 11
times 10
how 27
many 2
sisters 1
she 199
had 11
whether 1
they 5
were 5
older 1
or 333
younger 1
than 22
herself 1
whether 1
any 17
of 109
them 9
were 5
likely 1
to 805
be 1200
married 3
whether 1
they 5
were 5
handsome 6
where 21
they 5
had 11
been 1
educated 1
what 14
carriage 5
her 181
father 12
kept 1
and 51
what 14
had 11
been 1
her 181
mother's 1
maiden 13
name 17
elizabeth 5
felt 5
all 162
the 193
impertinence 3
of 109
her 181
questions 1
but 82
answered 1
them 9
very 1
composedly 1
lady 18
catherine 2
then 5
observed 1
your 4
father's 1
estate 3
is 124
entailed 1
on 86
mr 5
collins 1
i 4330
think 8
for 484
your 4
sake 2
turning 3
to 805
charlotte 4
i 4330
am 392
glad 30
of 109
it 67
but 82
otherwise 1
i 4330
see 70
no 896
occasion 7
for 484
entailing 1
estates 1
from 2
the 193
female 5
line 36
it 67
was 93
not 85
thought 11
necessary 2
in 2719
sir 22
lewis 1
de 2452
family 2
do 814
you 29
play 73
and 51
sing 52
miss 71
bennet 1
a 6799
little 6
oh 17
then 5
some 30
time 45
or 333
other 5
we 444
shall 12
be 1200
happy 1
to 805
hear 76
you 29
our 3
instrument 16
is 124
a 6799
capital 17
one 19
probably 1
superior 5
to 805
you 29
shall 12
try 12
it 67
some 30
day 27
do 814
your 4
sisters 1
play 73
and 51
sing 52
one 19
of 109
them 9
does 5
why 4
did 23
not 85
you 29
all 162
learn 9
you 29
ought 2
all 162
to 805
have 11
learned 2
the 193
miss 71
all 162
play 73
and 51
their 2
father 12
has 41
not 85
so 797
good 28
an 970
income 5
as 509
yours 3
do 814
you 29
draw 24
no 896
not 85
at 272
all 162
what 14
none 32
of 109
you 29
not 85
one 19
that 11
is 124
very 1
strange 8
but 82
i 4330
suppose 4
you 29
had 11
no 896
opportunity 2
your 4
mother 21
should 7
have 11
taken 1
you 29
to 805
town 27
every 10
spring 23
for 484
the 193
benefit 5
of 109
masters 4
my 90
mother 21
would 5
have 11
had 11
no 896
objection 5
but 82
my 90
father 12
hates 1
london 5
has 41
your 4
governess 3
left 19
you 29
we 444
never 3
had 11
any 17
governess 3
no 896
governess 3
how 27
was 93
that 11
possible 3
five 5
daughters 1
brought 1
up 194
at 272
home 90
without 1
a 6799
governess 3
i 4330
never 3
heard 1
of 109
such 2
a 6799
thing 15
your 4
mother 21
must 28
have 11
been 1
quite 1
a 6799
slave 14
to 805
your 4
education 9
elizabeth 5
could 2
hardly 1
help 23
smiling 2
as 509
she 199
assured 4
her 181
that 11
had 11
not 85
been 1
the 193
case 25
then 5
who 79
taught 1
you 29
who 79
attended 1
to 805
you 29
without 1
a 6799
governess 3
you 29
must 28
have 11
been 1
neglected 1
compared 1
with 34
some 30
families 1
i 4330
believe 6
we 444
were 5
but 82
such 2
of 109
us 70
as 509
wished 1
to 805
learn 9
never 3
wanted 1
the 193
means 1
we 444
were 5
always 1
encouraged 1
to 805
read 49
and 51
had 11
all 162
the 193
masters 4
that 11
were 5
necessary 2
those 1
who 79
chose 2
to 805
be 1200
idle 10
certainly 1
might 9
aye 4
no 896
doubt 15
but 82
that 11
is 124
what 14
a 6799
governess 3
will 39
prevent 13
and 51
if 8
i 4330
had 11
known 1
your 4
mother 21
i 4330
should 7
have 11
advised 2
her 181
most 3
strenuously 1
to 805
engage 6
one 19
i 4330
always 1
say 7
that 11
nothing 5
is 124
to 805
be 1200
done 3
in 2719
education 9
without 1
steady 3
and 51
regular 13
instruction 4
and 51
nobody 2
but 82
a 6799
governess 3
can 287
give 15
it 67
it 67
is 124
wonderful 4
how 27
many 2
families 1
i 4330
have 11
been 1
the 193
means 1
of 109
supplying 1
in 2719
that 11
way 27
i 4330
am 392
always 1
glad 30
to 805
get 13
a 6799
young 9
person 33
well 24
placed 1
out 365
four 26
nieces 1
of 109
mrs 1
are 12
most 3
delightfully 1
situated 1
through 4
my 90
means 1
and 51
it 67
was 93
but 82
the 193
other 5
day 27
that 11
i 4330
recommended 1
another 1
young 9
person 33
who 79
was 93
merely 1
accidentally 1
mentioned 1
to 805
me 1041
and 51
the 193
family 2
are 12
quite 1
delighted 2
with 34
her 181
mrs 1
collins 1
did 23
i 4330
tell 16
you 29
of 109
lady 18
calling 3
yesterday 3
to 805
thank 15
me 1041
she 199
finds 1
miss 71
pope 5
a 6799
treasure 7
catherine 2
said 1
she 199
have 11
given 3
me 1041
a 6799
treasure 7
are 12
any 17
of 109
your 4
younger 1
sisters 1
out 365
miss 71
bennet 1
yes 16
ma'am 1
all 162
all 162
what 14
all 162
five 5
out 365
at 272
once 2
very 1
odd 17
and 51
you 29
only 1
the 193
second 16
the 193
younger 1
ones 2
out 365
before 2
the 193
elder 7
ones 2
are 12
married 3
your 4
younger 1
sisters 1
must 28
be 1200
very 1
young 9
yes 16
my 90
youngest 1
is 124
not 85
sixteen 6
perhaps 1
she 199
is 124
full 16
young 9
to 805
be 1200
much 2
in 2719
company 2
but 82
really 1
ma'am 1
i 4330
think 8
it 67
would 5
be 1200
very 1
hard 70
upon 1
younger 1
sisters 1
that 11
they 5
should 7
not 85
have 11
their 2
share 22
of 109
society 2
and 51
amusement 3
because 1
the 193
elder 7
may 49
not 85
have 11
the 193
means 1
or 333
inclination 3
to 805
marry 2
early 1
the 193
last 7
born 4
has 41
as 509
good 28
a 6799
right 31
to 805
the 193
pleasures 1
of 109
youth 7
as 509
the 193
first 8
and 51
to 805
be 1200
kept 1
back 182
on 86
such 2
a 6799
motive 4
i 4330
think 8
it 67
would 5
not 85
be 1200
very 1
likely 1
to 805
promote 6
sisterly 1
affection 5
or 333
delicacy 2
of 109
mind 25
upon 1
my 90
word 26
said 1
her 181
ladyship 3
you 29
give 15
your 4
opinion 4
very 1
decidedly 1
for 484
so 797
young 9
a 6799
person 33
pray 9
what 14
is 124
your 4
age 24
with 34
three 12
younger 1
sisters 1
grown 4
up 194
replied 1
elizabeth 5
smiling 2
your 4
ladyship 3
can 287
hardly 1
expect 20
me 1041
to 805
own 9
it 67
lady 18
catherine 2
seemed 1
quite 1
astonished 1
at 272
not 85
receiving 1
a 6799
direct 30
answer 8
and 51
elizabeth 5
suspected 1
herself 1
to 805
be 1200
the 193
first 8
creature 3
who 79
had 11
ever 33
dared 6
to 805
trifle 7
with 34
so 797
much 2
dignified 1
impertinence 3
you 29
cannot 1
be 1200
more 11
than 22
twenty 2
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
therefore 1
you 29
need 29
not 85
conceal 10
your 4
age 24
i 4330
am 392
not 85
one 19
and 51
twenty 2
when 6
the 193
gentlemen 1
had 11
joined 1
them 9
and 51
tea 99
was 93
over 596

down 90
to 805

as 509
miss 71
de 2452
chose 2
to 805
play 73
at 272
the 193
two 14
girls 1
had 11
the 193
of 109
assisting 1
mrs 1
to 805
make 17
up 194
her 181
party 3
their 2
table 27
was 93
superlatively 1
stupid 9
scarcely 1
a 6799
syllable 3
was 93
uttered 1
that 11
did 23
not 85
relate 8
to 805
the 193
game 24
except 10
when 6
mrs 1
expressed 1
her 181
fears 2
of 109
miss 71
de 2452
being 3
too 50
hot 56
or 333
too 50
cold 9
or 333
having 1
too 50
much 2
or 333
too 50
little 6
light 42
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
more 11
passed 1
at 272
the 193
other 5
table 27
lady 18
catherine 2
was 93
generally 1
speaking 2
stating 1
the 193
mistakes 1
of 109
the 193
three 12
others 1
or 333
relating 1
some 30
anecdote 3
of 109
herself 1
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
employed 1
in 2719
agreeing 1
to 805
everything 2
her 181
ladyship 3
said 1
thanking 1
her 181
for 484
every 10
fish 46
he 962
won 33
and 51
if 8
he 962
thought 11
he 962
won 33
too 50
many 2
sir 22
william 3
did 23
not 85
say 7
much 2
he 962
was 93
storing 1
his 43
memory 2
with 34
anecdotes 1
and 51
noble 13
names 4
when 6
lady 18
catherine 2
and 51
her 181
daughter 4
had 11
played 1
as 509
long 49
as 509
they 5
chose 2
the 193
tables 7
were 5
broken 6
up 194
the 193
carriage 5
was 93
offered 1
to 805
mrs 1
collins 1
gratefully 1
accepted 1
and 51
immediately 1
ordered 1
the 193
party 3
then 5
gathered 1
round 29
the 193
fire 103
to 805
hear 76
lady 18
catherine 2
determine 7
what 14
weather 33
they 5
were 5
to 805
have 11
on 86
the 193
morrow 3
from 2
these 4
instructions 1
they 5
were 5
summoned 1
by 57
the 193
arrival 3
of 109
the 193
coach 11
and 51
with 34
many 2
speeches 1
of 109
thankfulness 2
on 86
mr 5
side 74
and 51
as 509
many 2
bows 7
on 86
sir 22
they 5
departed 2
as 509
soon 3
as 509
they 5
had 11
driven 1
from 2
the 193
door 41
elizabeth 5
was 93
called 1
on 86
by 57
her 181
cousin 3
to 805
give 15
her 181
opinion 4
of 109
all 162
that 11
she 199
had 11
seen 1
at 272
which 2
for 484
charlotte's 1
sake 2
she 199
made 13
more 11
than 22
it 67
really 1
was 93
but 82
her 181
commendation 3
though 12
costing 2
her 181
some 30
trouble 18
could 2
by 57
no 896
means 1
satisfy 3
mr 5
collins 1
and 51
he 962
was 93
very 1
soon 3
obliged 1
to 805
take 18
her 181
ladyship's 1
praise 7
into 26
his 43
own 9
hands 24
chapter 3
sir 22
william 3
stayed 1
only 1
a 6799
week 20
at 272
but 82
his 43
visit 14
was 93
long 49
enough 2
to 805
convince 3
him 9
of 109
his 43
daughter's 1
being 3
most 3
comfortably 1
settled 1
and 51
of 109
her 181
possessing 1
such 2
a 6799
husband 10
and 51
such 2
a 6799
as 509
were 5
not 85
often 4
met 180
with 34
while 4
sir 22
william 3
was 93
with 34
them 9
mr 5
collins 1
devoted 2
his 43
morning 3
to 805
driving 2
him 9
out 365
in 2719
his 43
gig 33
and 51
showing 3
him 9
the 193
country 12
but 82
when 6
he 962
went 1
away 1
the 193
whole 26
family 2
returned 1
to 805
their 2
usual 3
employments 1
and 51
elizabeth 5
was 93
thankful 4
to 805
find 10
that 11
they 5
did 23
not 85
see 70
more 11
of 109
her 181
cousin 3
by 57
the 193
alteration 3
for 484
the 193
chief 14
of 109
the 193
time 45
between 1
breakfast 5
and 51
dinner 9
was 93
now 10
passed 1
by 57
him 9
either 1
at 272
work 87
in 2719
the 193
garden 12
or 333
in 2719
reading 3
and 51
writing 3
and 51
looking 1
out 365
of 109
the 193
window 12
in 2719
his 43
own 9
book 69
room 22
which 2
fronted 1
the 193
road 38
the 193
room 22
in 2719
which 2
the 193
ladies 1
sat 92
was 93
backwards 1
elizabeth 5
had 11
at 272
first 8
rather 2
wondered 1
that 11
charlotte 4
should 7
not 85
prefer 13
the 193
dining 1
for 484
common 23
use 18
it 67
was 93
a 6799
better 7
sized 1
room 22
and 51
had 11
a 6799
more 11
pleasant 9
aspect 3
but 82
she 199
soon 3
saw 24
that 11
her 181
friend 14
had 11
an 970
excellent 2
reason 13
for 484
what 14
she 199
did 23
for 484
mr 5
collins 1
would 5
undoubtedly 1
have 11
been 1
much 2
less 19
in 2719
his 43
own 9
apartment 3
had 11
they 5
sat 92
in 2719
one 19
equally 1
lively 1
and 51
she 199
gave 4
charlotte 4
credit 12
for 484
the 193
arrangement 3
from 2
the 193
drawing 3
room 22
they 5
could 2
distinguish 5
nothing 5
in 2719
the 193
lane 3
and 51
were 5
indebted 3
to 805
mr 5
collins 1
for 484
the 193
knowledge 4
of 109
what 14
carriages 1
went 1
along 3
and 51
how 27
often 4
especially 1
miss 71
de 2452
drove 6
by 57
in 2719
her 181
phaeton 3
which 2
he 962
never 3
failed 1
coming 3
to 805
inform 21
them 9
of 109
though 12
it 67
happened 1
almost 1
every 10
day 27
she 199
not 85
stopped 1
at 272
the 193
parsonage 3
and 51
had 11
a 6799
few 6
conversation 8
with 34
charlotte 4
but 82
was 93
scarcely 1
ever 33
prevailed 1
upon 1
to 805
get 13
out 365
very 1
few 6
days 1
passed 1
in 2719
which 2
mr 5
collins 1
did 23
not 85
walk 25
to 805
and 51
not 85
many 2
in 2719
which 2
his 43
wife 6
did 23
not 85
think 8
it 67
necessary 2
to 805
go 500
likewise 1
and 51
till 14
elizabeth 5
recollected 1
that 11
there 21
might 9
be 1200
other 5
family 2
livings 3
to 805
be 1200
disposed 1
of 109
she 199
could 2
not 85
understand 8
the 193
sacrifice 4
of 109
so 797
many 2
hours 1
now 10
and 51
then 5
they 5
were 5
with 34
a 6799
call 57
from 2
her 181
ladyship 3
and 51
nothing 5
escaped 1
her 181
observation 4
that 11
was 93
passing 3
in 2719
the 193
room 22
during 1
these 4
visits 1
she 199
examined 1
into 26
their 2
employments 1
looked 1
at 272
their 2
work 87
and 51
advised 2
them 9
to 805
do 814
it 67
differently 1
found 18
fault 20
with 34
the 193
arrangement 3
of 109
the 193
furniture 2
or 333
detected 1
the 193
housemaid 3
in 2719
negligence 2
and 51
if 8
she 199
accepted 1
any 17
refreshment 4
seemed 1
to 805
do 814
it 67
only 1
for 484
the 193
sake 2
of 109
finding 4
out 365
that 11
mrs 1
joints 1
of 109
meat 17
were 5
too 50
large 11
for 484
her 181
family 2
elizabeth 5
soon 3
perceived 1
that 11
though 12
this 6
great 12
lady 18
was 93
not 85
in 2719
commission 10
of 109
the 193
peace 21
of 109
the 193
county 3
she 199
was 93
a 6799
most 3
active 6
magistrate 3
in 2719
her 181
own 9
parish 6
the 193
minutest 1
concerns 1
of 109
which 2
were 5
carried 1
to 805
her 181
by 57
mr 5
collins 1
and 51
whenever 1
any 17
of 109
the 193
cottagers 1
were 5
disposed 1
to 805
be 1200
quarrelsome 3
discontented 2
or 333
too 50
poor 11
she 199
sallied 1
forth 8
into 26
the 193
village 6
to 805
settle 10
their 2
differences 1
silence 7
their 2
complaints 1
and 51
scold 7
them 9
into 26
harmony 2
and 51
plenty 2
the 193
entertainment 3
of 109
dining 1
at 272
was 93
repeated 2
about 1
twice 1
a 6799
week 20
and 51
allowing 1
for 484
the 193
loss 3
of 109
sir 22
william 3
and 51
there 21
being 3
only 1
one 19
card 54
table 27
in 2719
the 193
evening 3
every 10
such 2
entertainment 3
was 93
the 193
counterpart 3
of 109
the 193
first 8
their 2
other 5
engagements 1
were 5
few 6
as 509
the 193
style 4
of 109
living 5
in 2719
the 193
in 2719
general 22
was 93
beyond 1
mr 5
reach 6
this 6
however 1
was 93
no 896
evil 15
to 805
elizabeth 5
and 51
upon 1
the 193
whole 26
she 199
spent 1
her 181
time 45
comfortably 1
enough 2
there 21
were 5
half 23
hours 1
of 109
pleasant 9
conversation 8
with 34
charlotte 4
and 51
the 193
weather 33
was 93
so 797
fine 17
for 484
the 193
time 45
of 109
year 19
that 11
she 199
had 11
often 4
great 12
enjoyment 3
out 365
of 109
doors 9
her 181
walk 25
and 51
where 21
she 199
frequently 1
went 1
while 4
the 193
others 1
were 5
calling 3
on 86
lady 18
catherine 2
was 93
along 3
the 193
open 21
grove 14
which 2
edged 1
that 11
side 74
of 109
the 193
park 18
where 21
there 21
was 93
a 6799
nice 11
sheltered 1
path 25
which 2
no 896
one 19
seemed 1
to 805
value 8
but 82
herself 1
and 51
where 21
she 199
felt 5
beyond 1
the 193
reach 6
of 109
lady 18
catherine's 1
curiosity 2
in 2719
this 6
quiet 20
way 27
the 193
first 8
fortnight 4
of 109
her 181
visit 14
soon 3
passed 1
away 1
easter 11
was 93
approaching 1
and 51
the 193
week 20
preceding 1
it 67
was 93
to 805
bring 6
an 970
addition 5
to 805
the 193
family 2
at 272
which 2
in 2719
so 797
small 14
a 6799
circle 7
must 28
be 1200
important 2
elizabeth 5
had 11
heard 1
soon 3
after 48
her 181
arrival 3
that 11
mr 5
darcy 2
was 93
expected 1
there 21
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
a 6799
few 6
weeks 2
and 51
though 12
there 21
were 5
not 85
many 2
of 109
her 181
acquaintances 3
whom 3
she 199
did 23
not 85
prefer 13
his 43
coming 3
would 5
furnish 6
one 19
comparatively 1
new 115
to 805
look 14
at 272
in 2719
their 2
parties 1
and 51
she 199
might 9
be 1200
amused 1
in 2719
seeing 2
how 27
hopeless 4
miss 71
designs 1
on 86
him 9
were 5
by 57
his 43
to 805
his 43
cousin 3
for 484
whom 3
he 962
was 93
evidently 1
destined 1
by 57
lady 18
catherine 2
who 79
talked 1
of 109
his 43
coming 3
with 34
the 193
greatest 1
satisfaction 3
spoke 14
of 109
him 9
in 2719
terms 1
of 109
the 193
highest 1
admiration 2
and 51
seemed 1
almost 1
angry 1
to 805
find 10
that 11
he 962
had 11
already 1
been 1
frequently 1
seen 1
by 57
miss 71
lucas 1
and 51
herself 1
his 43
arrival 3
was 93
soon 3
known 1
at 272
the 193
parsonage 3
for 484
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
walking 2
the 193
whole 26
morning 3
within 3
view 18
of 109
the 193
lodges 1
opening 3
into 26
lane 3
in 2719
order 11
to 805
have 11
the 193
earliest 1
assurance 3
of 109
it 67
and 51
after 48
making 4
his 43
bow 58
as 509
the 193
carriage 5
turned 1
into 26
the 193
park 18
hurried 2
home 90
with 34
the 193
great 12
intelligence 2
on 86
the 193
following 3
morning 3
he 962
hastened 1
to 805
to 805
pay 52
his 43
respects 1
there 21
were 5
two 14
nephews 1
of 109
lady 18
catherine 2
to 805
require 6
them 9
for 484
mr 5
darcy 2
had 11
brought 1
with 34
him 9
a 6799
colonel 5
the 193
younger 1
son 70
of 109
his 43
uncle 18
lord 13
and 51
to 805
the 193
great 12
surprise 4
of 109
all 162
the 193
party 3
when 6
mr 5
collins 1
returned 1
the 193
gentlemen 1
accompanied 1
him 9
charlotte 4
had 11
seen 1
them 9
from 2
her 181
husband's 1
room 22
crossing 3
the 193
road 38
and 51
immediately 1
running 2
into 26
the 193
other 5
told 1
the 193
girls 1
what 14
an 970
they 5
might 9
expect 20
adding 1
i 4330
may 49
thank 15
you 29
eliza 7
for 484
this 6
piece 10
of 109
civility 2
mr 5
darcy 2
would 5
never 3
have 11
come 36
so 797
soon 3
to 805
wait 19
upon 1
me 1041
elizabeth 5
had 11
scarcely 1
time 45
to 805
disclaim 7
all 162
right 31
to 805
the 193
compliment 6
before 2
their 2
approach 6
was 93
announced 1
by 57
the 193
door 41
bell 66
and 51
shortly 1
afterwards 1
the 193
three 12
gentlemen 1
entered 1
the 193
room 22
colonel 5
who 79
led 11
the 193
way 27
was 93
about 1
thirty 2
not 85
handsome 6
but 82
in 2719
person 33
and 51
address 9
most 3
truly 1
the 193
gentleman 3
mr 5
darcy 2
looked 1
just 24
as 509
he 962
had 11
been 1
used 1
to 805
look 14
in 2719
paid 1
his 43
compliments 1
with 34
his 43
usual 3
reserve 7
to 805
mrs 1
collins 1
and 51
whatever 1
might 9
be 1200
his 43
feelings 1
toward 2
her 181
friend 14
met 180
her 181
with 34
every 10
appearance 3
of 109
composure 2
elizabeth 5
merely 1
to 805
him 9
without 1
saying 3
a 6799
word 26
colonel 5
entered 1
into 26
conversation 8
directly 1
with 34
the 193
readiness 2
and 51
ease 10
of 109
a 6799
well 24
bred 1
man 342
and 51
talked 1
very 1
pleasantly 1
but 82
his 43
cousin 3
after 48
having 1
addressed 1
a 6799
slight 10
observation 4
on 86
the 193
house 87
and 51
garden 12
to 805
mrs 1
collins 1
sat 92
for 484
some 30
time 45
without 1
speaking 2
to 805
anybody 2
at 272
length 14
however 1
his 43
civility 2
was 93
so 797
far 91
awakened 1
as 509
to 805
inquire 6
of 109
elizabeth 5
after 48
the 193
health 12
of 109
her 181
family 2
she 199
answered 1
him 9
in 2719
the 193
usual 3
way 27
and 51
after 48
a 6799
moment's 1
pause 4
added 1
my 90
eldest 1
sister 9
has 41
been 1
in 2719
town 27
these 4
three 12
months 1
have 11
you 29
never 3
happened 1
to 805
see 70
her 181
there 21
she 199
was 93
perfectly 1
sensible 3
that 11
he 962
never 3
had 11
but 82
she 199
wished 1
to 805
see 70
whether 1
he 962
would 5
betray 10
any 17
consciousness 3
of 109
what 14
had 11
passed 1
between 1
the 193
and 51
jane 8
and 51
she 199
thought 11
he 962
looked 1
a 6799
little 6
confused 2
as 509
he 962
answered 1
that 11
he 962
had 11
never 3
been 1
so 797
fortunate 2
as 509
to 805
meet 9
miss 71
bennet 1
the 193
subject 11
was 93
pursued 1
no 896
farther 2
and 51
the 193
gentlemen 1
soon 3
afterwards 1
went 1
away 1
chapter 3
colonel 5
manners 1
were 5
very 1
much 2
admired 1
at 272
the 193
parsonage 3
and 51
the 193
ladies 1
all 162
felt 5
that 11
he 962
must 28
add 54
considerably 1
to 805
the 193
pleasures 1
of 109
their 2
engagements 1
at 272
it 67
was 93
some 30
days 1
however 1
before 2
they 5
received 1
any 17
invitation 6
thither 1
for 484
while 4
there 21
were 5
visitors 1
in 2719
the 193
house 87
they 5
could 2
not 85
be 1200
necessary 2
and 51
it 67
was 93
not 85
till 14
easter 11
day 27
almost 1
a 6799
week 20
after 48
the 193
arrival 3
that 11
they 5
were 5
by 57
such 2
an 970
attention 3
and 51
then 5
they 5
were 5
merely 1
asked 1
on 86
leaving 3
church 21
to 805
come 36
there 21
in 2719
the 193
evening 3
for 484
the 193
last 7
week 20
they 5
had 11
seen 1
very 1
little 6
of 109
lady 18
catherine 2
or 333
her 181
daughter 4
colonel 5
had 11
called 1
at 272
the 193
parsonage 3
more 11
than 22
once 2
during 1
the 193
time 45
but 82
mr 5
darcy 2
they 5
had 11
seen 1
only 1
at 272
church 21
the 193
invitation 6
was 93
accepted 1
of 109
course 10
and 51
at 272
a 6799
proper 9
hour 10
they 5
joined 1
the 193
party 3
in 2719
lady 18
catherine's 1
drawing 3
room 22
her 181
ladyship 3
received 1
them 9
civilly 1
but 82
it 67
was 93
plain 27
that 11
their 2
company 2
was 93
by 57
no 896
means 1
so 797
acceptable 3
as 509
when 6
she 199
could 2
get 13
nobody 2
else 2
and 51
she 199
was 93
in 2719
fact 35
almost 1
engrossed 1
by 57
her 181
nephews 1
speaking 2
to 805
them 9
especially 1
to 805
darcy 2
much 2
more 11
than 22
to 805
any 17
other 5
person 33
in 2719
the 193
room 22
colonel 5
seemed 1
really 1
glad 30
to 805
see 70
them 9
anything 3
was 93
a 6799
welcome 4
relief 3
to 805
him 9
at 272
and 51
mrs 1
pretty 3
friend 14
had 11
moreover 1
caught 1
his 43
fancy 5
very 1
much 2
he 962
now 10
seated 1
himself 1
by 57
her 181
and 51
talked 1
so 797
agreeably 1
of 109
kent 9
and 51
of 109
and 51
staying 1
at 272
home 90
of 109
new 115
books 15
and 51
music 24
that 11
elizabeth 5
had 11
never 3
been 1
half 23
so 797
well 24
entertained 1
in 2719
that 11
room 22
before 2
and 51
they 5
conversed 1
with 34
so 797
much 2
spirit 20
and 51
flow 27
as 509
to 805
draw 24
the 193
attention 3
of 109
lady 18
catherine 2
herself 1
as 509
well 24
as 509
of 109
mr 5
darcy 2
his 43
eyes 8
had 11
been 1
soon 3
and 51
repeatedly 1
turned 1
towards 1
them 9
with 34
a 6799
look 14
of 109
curiosity 2
and 51
that 11
her 181
ladyship 3
after 48
a 6799
while 4
shared 1
the 193
feeling 4
was 93
more 11
openly 1
acknowledged 1
for 484
she 199
did 23
not 85
scruple 4
to 805
call 57
out 365
what 14
is 124
that 11
you 29
are 12
saying 3
what 14
is 124
it 67
you 29
are 12
talking 1
of 109
what 14
are 12
you 29
telling 2
miss 71
bennet 1
let 50
me 1041
hear 76
what 14
it 67
is 124
we 444
are 12
speaking 2
of 109
music 24
madam 5
said 1
he 962
when 6
no 896
longer 1
able 3
to 805
avoid 8
a 6799
reply 3
of 109
music 24
then 5

of 109
all 162
subjects 1

have 11
my 90
share 22
in 2719
the 193
conversation 8
if 8
you 29

speaking 2
of 109
music 24
there 21
are 12
few 6
people 4
in 2719
england 2
i 4330
suppose 4
who 79
have 11
more 11
true 9
enjoyment 3
of 109
music 24
than 22
myself 1
or 333
a 6799
better 7
natural 18
taste 15
if 8
i 4330
had 11
ever 33
i 4330
should 7
have 11
been 1
a 6799
great 12
proficient 4
and 51
so 797
would 5
anne 18
if 8
her 181
health 12
had 11
allowed 1
her 181
to 805
apply 2
i 4330
am 392
confident 6
that 11
she 199
would 5
have 11
performed 1
delightfully 1
how 27
does 5
get 13
on 86
darcy 2
mr 5
darcy 2
spoke 14
with 34
affectionate 2
praise 7
of 109
his 43
sister's 1
proficiency 2
i 4330
am 392
very 1
glad 30
to 805
hear 76
such 2
a 6799
good 28
account 14
of 109
her 181
said 1
lady 18
catherine 2
and 51
pray 9
tell 16
her 181
from 2
me 1041
that 11
she 199
cannot 1
expect 20
to 805
excel 13
if 8
she 199
does 5
not 85
practice 4
a 6799
good 28
deal 13
i 4330
assure 6
you 29
madam 5
he 962
replied 1
that 11
she 199
does 5
not 85
need 29
such 2
advice 2
she 199
very 1
constantly 1
so 797
much 2
the 193
better 7
it 67
cannot 1
be 1200
done 3
too 50
much 2
and 51
when 6
i 4330
next 2
write 5
to 805
her 181
i 4330
shall 12
charge 8
her 181
not 85
to 805
neglect 9
it 67
on 86
any 17
account 14
i 4330
often 4
tell 16
young 9
ladies 1
that 11
no 896
excellence 2
in 2719
music 24
is 124
to 805
be 1200
acquired 1
without 1
constant 7
practice 4
i 4330
have 11
told 1
miss 71
bennet 1
several 3
times 10
that 11
she 199
will 39
never 3
play 73
really 1
well 24
unless 1
she 199
more 11
and 51
though 12
mrs 1
collins 1
has 41
no 896
instrument 16
she 199
is 124
very 1
welcome 4
as 509
i 4330
have 11
often 4
told 1
her 181
to 805
come 36
to 805
every 10
day 27
and 51
play 73
on 86
the 193
pianoforte 3
in 2719
mrs 1
room 22
she 199
would 5
be 1200
in 2719
nobody's 1
way 27
you 29
know 12
in 2719
that 11
part 102
of 109
the 193
house 87
mr 5
darcy 2
looked 1
a 6799
little 6
ashamed 2
of 109
his 43
aunt's 1
ill 84
breeding 2
and 51
made 13
no 896
answer 8
when 6
coffee 15
was 93
over 596
colonel 5
reminded 1
elizabeth 5
of 109
having 1
promised 1
to 805
play 73
to 805
him 9
and 51
she 199
sat 92
down 90
directly 1
to 805
the 193
instrument 16
he 962
drew 2
a 6799
chair 20
near 15
her 181
lady 18
catherine 2
listened 1
to 805
half 23
a 6799
song 26
and 51
then 5
talked 1
as 509
before 2
to 805
her 181
other 5
nephew 3
till 14
the 193
latter 3
walked 1
away 1
from 2
her 181
and 51
making 4
with 34
his 43
usual 3
deliberation 3
towards 1
the 193
pianoforte 3
stationed 1
himself 1
so 797
as 509
to 805
command 21
a 6799
full 16
view 18
of 109
the 193
fair 25
performer's 1
countenance 4
elizabeth 5
saw 24
what 14
he 962
was 93
doing 3
and 51
at 272
the 193
first 8
convenient 2
pause 4
turned 1
to 805
him 9
with 34
an 970
arch 97
smile 7
and 51
said 1
you 29
mean 36
to 805
frighten 5
me 1041
mr 5
darcy 2
by 57
coming 3
in 2719
all 162
this 6
state 41
to 805
hear 76
me 1041
i 4330
will 39
not 85
be 1200
alarmed 1
though 12
your 4
sister 9
does 5
play 73
so 797
well 24
there 21
is 124
a 6799
stubbornness 2
about 1
me 1041
that 11
never 3
can 287
bear 30
to 805
be 1200
frightened 1
at 272
the 193
will 39
of 109
others 1
my 90
courage 6
always 1
rises 1
at 272
every 10
attempt 5
to 805
intimidate 3
me 1041
i 4330
shall 12
not 85
say 7
you 29
are 12
mistaken 2
he 962
replied 1
because 1
you 29
could 2
not 85
really 1
believe 6
me 1041
to 805
entertain 12
any 17
design 16
of 109
alarming 2
you 29
and 51
i 4330
have 11
had 11
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
your 4
acquaintance 5
long 49
enough 2
to 805
know 12
that 11
you 29
find 10
great 12
enjoyment 3
in 2719
occasionally 1
professing 1
opinions 1
which 2
in 2719
fact 35
are 12
not 85
your 4
own 9
elizabeth 5
laughed 1
heartily 1
at 272
this 6
picture 8
of 109
herself 1
and 51
said 1
to 805
colonel 5
your 4
cousin 3
will 39
give 15
you 29
a 6799
very 1
pretty 3
notion 5
of 109
me 1041
and 51
teach 9
you 29
not 85
to 805
believe 6
a 6799
word 26
i 4330
say 7
i 4330
am 392
particularly 1
unlucky 1
in 2719
meeting 6
with 34
a 6799
person 33
so 797
able 3
to 805
expose 4
my 90
real 47
character 16
in 2719
a 6799
part 102
of 109
the 193
world 12
where 21
i 4330
had 11
hoped 1
to 805
pass 66
myself 1
off 100
with 34
some 30
degree 3
of 109
credit 12
indeed 1
mr 5
darcy 2
it 67
is 124
very 1
ungenerous 1
in 2719
you 29
to 805
mention 5
all 162
that 11
you 29
knew 1
to 805
my 90
disadvantage 6
in 2719
and 51
give 15
me 1041
leave 14
to 805
say 7
very 1
impolitic 1
too 50
for 484
it 67
is 124
provoking 2
me 1041
to 805
retaliate 3
and 51
such 2
things 1
may 49
come 36
out 365
as 509
will 39
shock 12
your 4
relations 4
to 805
hear 76
i 4330
am 392
not 85
afraid 1
of 109
you 29
said 1
he 962
smilingly 1
pray 9
let 50
me 1041
hear 76
what 14
you 29
have 11
to 805
accuse 6
him 9
of 109
cried 1
colonel 5
i 4330
should 7
like 22
to 805
know 12
how 27
he 962
behaves 1
among 1
strangers 1
you 29
shall 12
hear 76
then 5
but 82
prepare 5
yourself 1
for 484
something 3
very 1
dreadful 4
the 193
first 8
time 45
of 109
my 90
ever 33
seeing 2
him 9
in 2719
you 29
must 28
know 12
was 93
at 272
a 6799
ball 77
and 51
at 272
this 6
ball 77
what 14
do 814
you 29
think 8
he 962
did 23
he 962
danced 1
only 1
four 26
dances 1
though 12
gentlemen 1
were 5
scarce 6
and 51
to 805
my 90
certain 5
knowledge 4
more 11
than 22
one 19
young 9
lady 18
was 93
sitting 3
down 90
in 2719
want 13
of 109
a 6799
partner 8
mr 5
darcy 2
you 29
cannot 1
deny 2
the 193
fact 35
i 4330
had 11
not 85
at 272
that 11
time 45
the 193
of 109
knowing 3
any 17
lady 18
in 2719
the 193
assembly 8
beyond 1
my 90
own 9
party 3
true 9
and 51
nobody 2
can 287
ever 33
be 1200
introduced 1
in 2719
a 6799
ball 77
room 22
well 24
colonel 5
what 14
do 814
i 4330
play 73
next 2
my 90
fingers 1
wait 19
your 4
orders 1
perhaps 1
said 1
darcy 2
i 4330
should 7
have 11
judged 1
better 7
had 11
i 4330
sought 1
an 970
introduction 3
but 82
i 4330
am 392
ill 84
qualified 1
to 805
recommend 8
myself 1
to 805
strangers 1
shall 12
we 444
ask 6
your 4
cousin 3
the 193
reason 13
of 109
this 6
said 1
elizabeth 5
still 13
addressing 1
colonel 5
shall 12
we 444
ask 6
him 9
why 4
a 6799
man 342
of 109
sense 8
and 51
education 9
and 51
who 79
has 41
lived 1
in 2719
the 193
world 12
is 124
ill 84
qualified 1
to 805
recommend 8
himself 1
to 805
strangers 1
i 4330
can 287
answer 8
your 4
question 16
said 1
without 1
applying 1
to 805
him 9
it 67
is 124
because 1
he 962
will 39
not 85
give 15
himself 1
the 193
trouble 18
i 4330
certainly 1
have 11
not 85
the 193
talent 4
which 2
some 30
people 4
possess 16
said 1
darcy 2
of 109
conversing 1
easily 1
with 34
those 1
i 4330
have 11
never 3
seen 1
before 2
i 4330
cannot 1
catch 24
their 2
tone 12
of 109
conversation 8
or 333
appear 7
interested 1
in 2719
their 2
concerns 1
as 509
i 4330
often 4
see 70
done 3
my 90
fingers 1
said 1
elizabeth 5
do 814
not 85
move 10
over 596
this 6
instrument 16
in 2719
the 193
masterly 1
manner 8
which 2
i 4330
see 70
so 797
many 2
do 814
they 5
have 11
not 85
the 193
same 5
force 10
or 333
rapidity 2
and 51
do 814
not 85
produce 7
the 193
same 5
expression 11
but 82
then 5
i 4330
have 11
always 1
supposed 2
it 67
to 805
be 1200
my 90
own 9
fault 20
because 1
i 4330
will 39
not 85
take 18
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
it 67
is 124
not 85
that 11
i 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
my 90
fingers 1
as 509
capable 1
as 509
any 17
other 5
woman's 1
of 109
superior 5
execution 6
darcy 2
smiled 1
and 51
said 1
you 29
are 12
perfectly 1
right 31
you 29
have 11
employed 1
your 4
time 45
much 2
better 7
no 896
one 19
admitted 2
to 805
the 193
privilege 4
of 109
hearing 3
you 29
can 287
think 8
anything 3
wanting 1
we 444
neither 1
of 109
us 70
perform 10
to 805
strangers 1
here 31
they 5
were 5
interrupted 1
by 57
lady 18
catherine 2
who 79
called 1
out 365
to 805
know 12
what 14
they 5
were 5
talking 1
of 109
elizabeth 5
immediately 1
began 1
playing 1
again 2
lady 18
catherine 2
approached 1
and 51
after 48
listening 1
for 484
a 6799
few 6
minutes 2
said 1
to 805
darcy 2
miss 71
bennet 1
would 5
not 85
play 73
at 272
all 162
amiss 1
if 8
she 199
more 11
and 51
could 2
have 11
the 193
advantage 6
of 109
a 6799
london 5
master 28
she 199
has 41
a 6799
very 1
good 28
notion 5
of 109
fingering 3
though 12
her 181
taste 15
is 124
not 85
equal 17
to 805
anne 18
would 5
have 11
been 1
a 6799
delightful 2
performer 3
had 11
her 181
health 12
allowed 1
her 181
to 805
learn 9
elizabeth 5
looked 1
at 272
darcy 2
to 805
see 70
how 27
cordially 1
he 962
assented 1
to 805
his 43
cousin's 1
praise 7
but 82
neither 1
at 272
that 11
moment 14
nor 102
at 272
any 17
other 5
could 2
she 199
discern 9
any 17
symptom 5
of 109
love 29
and 51
from 2
the 193
whole 26
of 109
his 43
to 805
miss 71
de 2452
she 199
derived 1
this 6
comfort 14
for 484
miss 71
that 11
he 962
might 9
have 11
been 1
just 24
as 509
likely 1
to 805
marry 2
her 181
had 11
she 199
been 1
his 43
relation 7
lady 18
catherine 2
continued 1
her 181
remarks 1
on 86
elizabeth's 1
performance 3
mixing 1
with 34
them 9
many 2
instructions 1
on 86
execution 6
and 51
taste 15
elizabeth 5
received 1
them 9
with 34
all 162
the 193
forbearance 2
of 109
civility 2
and 51
at 272
the 193
request 6
of 109
the 193
gentlemen 1
remained 1
at 272
the 193
instrument 16
till 14
her 181
ladyship's 1
carriage 5
was 93
ready 2
to 805
take 18
them 9
all 162
home 90
chapter 3
elizabeth 5
was 93
sitting 3
by 57
herself 1
the 193
next 2
morning 3
and 51
writing 3
to 805
jane 8
while 4
mrs 1
collins 1
and 51
maria 12
were 5
gone 4
on 86
business 13
into 26
the 193
village 6
when 6
she 199
was 93
startled 1
by 57
a 6799
ring 30
at 272
the 193
door 41
the 193
certain 5
signal 18
of 109
a 6799
visitor 3
as 509
she 199
had 11
heard 1
no 896
carriage 5
she 199
thought 11
it 67
not 85
unlikely 1
to 805
be 1200
lady 18
catherine 2
and 51
under 288
that 11
apprehension 3
was 93
putting 1
away 1
her 181
half 23
finished 1
letter 20
that 11
she 199
might 9
escape 10
all 162
impertinent 2
questions 1
when 6
the 193
door 41
opened 1
and 51
to 805
her 181
very 1
great 12
surprise 4
mr 5
darcy 2
and 51
mr 5
darcy 2
only 1
entered 1
the 193
room 22
he 962
seemed 1
astonished 1
too 50
on 86
finding 4
her 181
alone 1
and 51
for 484
his 43
intrusion 3
by 57
letting 2
her 181
know 12
that 11
he 962
had 11
understood 1
all 162
the 193
ladies 1
were 5
to 805
be 1200
within 3
they 5
then 5
sat 92
down 90
and 51
when 6
her 181
inquiries 1
after 48
were 5
made 13
seemed 1
in 2719
danger 7
of 109
sinking 1
into 26
total 17
silence 7
it 67
was 93
absolutely 1
necessary 2
therefore 1
to 805
think 8
of 109
something 3
and 51
in 2719
this 6
emergence 2
recollecting 1
when 6
she 199
had 11
seen 1
him 9
last 7
in 2719
and 51
feeling 4
curious 4
to 805
know 12
what 14
he 962
would 5
say 7
on 86
the 193
subject 11
of 109
their 2
hasty 1
departure 3
she 199
observed 1
how 27
very 1
suddenly 1
you 29
all 162
last 7
november 3
mr 5
darcy 2
it 67
must 28
have 11
been 1
a 6799
most 3
agreeable 3
surprise 4
to 805
mr 5
to 805
see 70
you 29
all 162
after 48
him 9
so 797
soon 3
for 484
if 8
i 4330
recollect 7
right 31
he 962
went 1
but 82
the 193
day 27
before 2
he 962
and 51
his 43
sisters 1
were 5
well 24
i 4330
hope 16
when 6
you 29
left 19
london 5
perfectly 1
so 797
i 4330
thank 15
you 29
she 199
found 18
that 11
she 199
was 93
to 805
receive 8
no 896
other 5
answer 8
and 51
after 48
a 6799
short 62
pause 4
added 1
i 4330
think 8
i 4330
have 11
understood 1
that 11
mr 5
has 41
not 85
much 2
idea 21
of 109
ever 33
returning 1
to 805
again 2
i 4330
have 11
never 3
heard 1
him 9
say 7
so 797
but 82
it 67
is 124
probable 3
that 11
he 962
may 49
spend 11
very 1
little 6
of 109
his 43
time 45
there 21
in 2719
the 193
future 3
he 962
has 41
many 2
friends 4
and 51
is 124
at 272
a 6799
time 45
of 109
life 44
when 6
friends 4
and 51
engagements 1
are 12
continually 1
increasing 2
if 8
he 962
means 1
to 805
be 1200
but 82
little 6
at 272
it 67
would 5
be 1200
better 7
for 484
the 193
that 11
he 962
should 7
give 15
up 194
the 193
place 29
entirely 1
for 484
then 5
we 444
might 9
possibly 1
get 13
a 6799
settled 1
family 2
there 21
but 82
perhaps 1
mr 5
did 23
not 85
take 18
the 193
house 87
so 797
much 2
for 484
the 193
convenience 3
of 109
the 193
as 509
for 484
his 43
own 9
and 51
we 444
must 28
expect 20
him 9
to 805
keep 11
it 67
or 333
quit 14
it 67
on 86
the 193
same 5
principle 4
i 4330
should 7
not 85
be 1200
surprised 1
said 1
darcy 2
if 8
he 962
were 5
to 805
give 15
it 67
up 194
as 509
soon 3
as 509
any 17
eligible 1
purchase 7
offers 1
elizabeth 5
made 13
no 896
answer 8
she 199
was 93
afraid 1
of 109
talking 1
longer 1
of 109
his 43
friend 14
and 51
having 1
nothing 5
else 2
to 805
say 7
was 93
now 10
determined 2
to 805
leave 14
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
finding 4
a 6799
subject 11
to 805
him 9
he 962
took 1
the 193
hint 13
and 51
soon 3
began 1
with 34
this 6
seems 1
a 6799
very 1
comfortable 3
house 87
lady 18
catherine 2
i 4330
believe 6
did 23
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
to 805
it 67
when 6
mr 5
collins 1
first 8
came 36
to 805
i 4330
believe 6
she 199
did 23
and 51
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
she 199
could 2
not 85
have 11
bestowed 1
her 181
kindness 3
on 86
a 6799
more 11
grateful 4
object 26
mr 5
collins 1
appears 1
to 805
be 1200
very 1
fortunate 2
in 2719
his 43
choice 5
of 109
a 6799
wife 6
yes 16
indeed 1
his 43
friends 4
may 49
well 24
rejoice 3
in 2719
his 43
having 1
met 180
with 34
one 19
of 109
the 193
very 1
few 6
sensible 3
women 5
who 79
would 5
have 11
accepted 1
him 9
or 333
have 11
made 13
him 9
happy 1
if 8
they 5
had 11
my 90
friend 14
has 41
an 970
excellent 2
understanding 4
though 12
i 4330
am 392
not 85
certain 5
that 11
i 4330
consider 13
her 181
marrying 1
mr 5
collins 1
as 509
the 193
wisest 1
thing 15
she 199
ever 33
did 23
she 199
seems 1
perfectly 1
happy 1
however 1
and 51
in 2719
a 6799
prudential 3
light 42
it 67
is 124
certainly 1
a 6799
very 1
good 28
match 25
for 484
her 181
it 67
must 28
be 1200
very 1
agreeable 3
for 484
her 181
to 805
be 1200
settled 1
within 3
so 797
easy 2
a 6799
distance 4
of 109
her 181
own 9
family 2
and 51
friends 4
an 970
easy 2
distance 4
do 814
you 29
call 57
it 67
it 67
is 124
nearly 1
fifty 2
miles 4
and 51
what 14
is 124
fifty 2
miles 4
of 109
good 28
road 38

more 11
than 22
half 23
a 6799
day's 1
journey 11
yes 16
i 4330
call 57
it 67
a 6799
very 1
easy 2
distance 4
i 4330
should 7
never 3
have 11
considered 1
the 193
distance 4
as 509
one 19
of 109
the 193
advantages 1
of 109
the 193
match 25
cried 1
elizabeth 5
i 4330
should 7
never 3
have 11
said 1
mrs 1
collins 1
was 93
settled 1
near 15
her 181
family 2
it 67
is 124
a 6799
proof 11
of 109
your 4
own 9
attachment 3
to 805
anything 3
beyond 1
the 193
very 1
of 109
i 4330
suppose 4
would 5
appear 7
far 91
as 509
he 962
spoke 14
there 21
was 93
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
smile 7
which 2
elizabeth 5
fancied 1
she 199
understood 1
he 962
must 28
be 1200
supposing 1
her 181
to 805
be 1200
thinking 2
of 109
jane 8
and 51
and 51
she 199
blushed 1
as 509
she 199
answered 1
i 4330
do 814
not 85
mean 36
to 805
say 7
that 11
a 6799
woman 21
may 49
not 85
be 1200
settled 1
too 50
near 15
her 181
family 2
the 193
far 91
and 51
the 193
near 15
must 28
be 1200
relative 4
and 51
depend 17
on 86
many 2
varying 1
circumstances 1
where 21
there 21
is 124
fortune 8
to 805
make 17
the 193
expenses 1
of 109
unimportant 1
distance 4
becomes 1
no 896
evil 15
but 82
that 11
is 124
not 85
the 193
case 25
here 31
mr 5
and 51
mrs 1
collins 1
have 11
a 6799
comfortable 3
income 5
but 82
not 85
such 2
a 6799
one 19
as 509
will 39
allow 9
of 109
frequent 9
journeys 1
and 51
i 4330
am 392
persuaded 1
my 90
friend 14
would 5
not 85
call 57
herself 1
near 15
her 181
family 2
under 288
less 19
than 22
half 23
the 193
present 20
distance 4
mr 5
darcy 2
drew 2
his 43
chair 20
a 6799
little 6
towards 1
her 181
and 51
said 1
you 29
cannot 1
have 11
a 6799
right 31
to 805
such 2
very 1
strong 16
local 16
attachment 3
you 29
cannot 1
have 11
been 1
always 1
at 272
elizabeth 5
looked 1
surprised 1
the 193
gentleman 3
experienced 1
some 30
change 21
of 109
feeling 4
he 962
drew 2
back 182
his 43
chair 20
took 1
a 6799
newspaper 9
from 2
the 193
table 27
and 51
glancing 1
over 596
it 67
said 1
in 2719
a 6799
colder 1
voice 8
are 12
you 29
pleased 1
with 34
kent 9
a 6799
short 62
dialogue 3
on 86
the 193
subject 11
of 109
the 193
country 12
ensued 1
on 86
either 1
side 74
calm 10
and 51
concise 6
and 51
soon 3
put 47
an 970
end 92
to 805
by 57
the 193
entrance 6
of 109
charlotte 4
and 51
her 181
sister 9
just 24
returned 1
from 2
her 181
walk 25
the 193
t 6034

te 887
surprised 1
them 9
mr 5
darcy 2
related 3
the 193
mistake 5
which 2
had 11
occasioned 1
his 43
intruding 1
on 86
miss 71
bennet 1
and 51
after 48
sitting 3
a 6799
few 6
minutes 2
longer 1
without 1
saying 3
much 2
to 805
anybody 2
went 1
away 1
what 14
can 287
be 1200
the 193
meaning 11
of 109
this 6
said 1
charlotte 4
as 509
soon 3
as 509
he 962
was 93
gone 4
my 90
dear 15
eliza 7
he 962
must 28
be 1200
in 2719
love 29
with 34
you 29
or 333
he 962
would 5
never 3
have 11
called 1
us 70
in 2719
this 6
familiar 12
way 27
but 82
when 6
elizabeth 5
told 1
of 109
his 43
silence 7
it 67
did 23
not 85
seem 10
very 1
likely 1
even 36
to 805
charlotte's 1
wishes 1
to 805
be 1200
the 193
case 25
and 51
after 48
various 2
conjectures 1
they 5
could 2
at 272
last 7
only 1
suppose 4
his 43
visit 14
to 805
proceed 7
from 2
the 193
difficulty 2
of 109
finding 4
anything 3
to 805
do 814
which 2
was 93
the 193
more 11
probable 3
from 2
the 193
time 45
of 109
year 19
all 162
field 15
sports 24
were 5
over 596
within 3
doors 9
there 21
was 93
lady 18
catherine 2
books 15
and 51
a 6799
billiard 3
table 27
but 82
gentlemen 1
cannot 1
always 1
be 1200
within 3
doors 9
and 51
in 2719
the 193
nearness 2
of 109
the 193
parsonage 3
or 333
the 193
pleasantness 2
of 109
the 193
walk 25
to 805
it 67
or 333
of 109
the 193
people 4
who 79
lived 1
in 2719
it 67
the 193
two 14
cousins 1
found 18
a 6799
temptation 3
from 2
this 6
period 16
of 109
walking 2
thither 1
almost 1
every 10
day 27
they 5
called 1
at 272
various 2
times 10
of 109
the 193
morning 3
sometimes 1
separately 1
sometimes 1
together 3
and 51
now 10
and 51
then 5
accompanied 1
by 57
their 2
aunt 6
it 67
was 93
plain 27
to 805
them 9
all 162
that 11
colonel 5
came 36
because 1
he 962
had 11
pleasure 5
in 2719
their 2
society 2
a 6799
persuasion 3
which 2
of 109
course 10
recommended 1
him 9
still 13
more 11
and 51
elizabeth 5
was 93
reminded 1
by 57
her 181
own 9
satisfaction 3
in 2719
being 3
with 34
him 9
as 509
well 24
as 509
by 57
his 43
evident 2
admiration 2
of 109
her 181
of 109
her 181
former 3
george 6
and 51
though 12
in 2719
comparing 1
them 9
she 199
saw 24
there 21
was 93
less 19
captivating 1
softness 2
in 2719
colonel 5
manners 1
she 199
believed 1
he 962
might 9
have 11
the 193
best 37
informed 1
mind 25
but 82
why 4
mr 5
darcy 2
came 36
so 797
often 4
to 805
the 193
parsonage 3
it 67
was 93
more 11
difficult 5
to 805
understand 8
it 67
could 2
not 85
be 1200
for 484
society 2
as 509
he 962
frequently 1
sat 92
there 21
ten 151
minutes 2
together 3
without 1
opening 3
his 43
lips 8
and 51
when 6
he 962
did 23
speak 12
it 67
seemed 1
the 193
effect 15
of 109
necessity 2
rather 2
than 22
of 109
choice 5
a 6799
sacrifice 4
to 805
propriety 2
not 85
a 6799
pleasure 5
to 805
himself 1
he 962
seldom 1
appeared 1
really 1
animated 2
mrs 1
collins 1
knew 1
not 85
what 14
to 805
make 17
of 109
him 9
colonel 5
occasionally 1
laughing 6
at 272
his 43
stupidity 2
proved 1
that 11
he 962
was 93
generally 1
different 11
which 2
her 181
own 9
knowledge 4
of 109
him 9
could 2
not 85
have 11
told 1
her 181
and 51
as 509
she 199
would 5
liked 1
to 805
have 11
believed 1
this 6
change 21
the 193
effect 15
of 109
love 29
and 51
the 193
object 26
of 109
that 11
love 29
her 181
friend 14
eliza 7
she 199
set 40
herself 1
seriously 1
to 805
work 87
to 805
find 10
it 67
out 365
she 199
watched 1
him 9
whenever 1
they 5
were 5
at 272
and 51
whenever 1
he 962
came 36
to 805
but 82
without 1
much 2
success 13
he 962
certainly 1
looked 1
at 272
her 181
friend 14
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
but 82
the 193
expression 11
of 109
that 11
look 14
was 93
disputable 1
it 67
was 93
an 970
earnest 8
steadfast 4
gaze 21
but 82
she 199
often 4
doubted 1
whether 1
there 21
were 5
much 2
admiration 2
in 2719
it 67
and 51
sometimes 1
it 67
seemed 1
nothing 5
but 82
absence 3
of 109
mind 25
she 199
had 11
once 2
or 333
twice 1
suggested 1
to 805
elizabeth 5
the 193
possibility 2
of 109
his 43
being 3
partial 6
to 805
her 181
but 82
elizabeth 5
always 1
laughed 1
at 272
the 193
idea 21
and 51
mrs 1
collins 1
did 23
not 85
think 8
it 67
right 31
to 805
press 30
the 193
subject 11
from 2
the 193
danger 7
of 109
raising 1
expectations 1
which 2
might 9
only 1
end 92
in 2719
disappointment 3
for 484
in 2719
her 181
opinion 4
it 67
admitted 2
not 85
of 109
a 6799
doubt 15
that 11
all 162
her 181
friend's 1
dislike 4
would 5
vanish 5
if 8
she 199
could 2
suppose 4
him 9
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
her 181
power 19
in 2719
her 181
kind 31
schemes 1
for 484
elizabeth 5
she 199
sometimes 1
planned 1
her 181
marrying 1
colonel 5
he 962
was 93
beyond 1
comparison 3
the 193
most 3
pleasant 9
man 342
he 962
certainly 1
admired 1
her 181
and 51
his 43
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
was 93
most 3
eligible 1
but 82
to 805
counterbalance 4
these 4
advantages 1
mr 5
darcy 2
had 11
considerable 1
patronage 3
in 2719
the 193
church 21
and 51
his 43
cousin 3
could 2
have 11
none 32
at 272
all 162
chapter 3
more 11
than 22
once 2
did 23
elizabeth 5
in 2719
her 181
ramble 7
within 3
the 193
park 18
unexpectedly 1
meet 9
mr 5
darcy 2
she 199
felt 5
all 162
the 193
perverseness 2
of 109
the 193
mischance 3
that 11
should 7
bring 6
him 9
where 21
no 896
one 19
else 2
was 93
brought 1
and 51
to 805
prevent 13
its 2
ever 33
happening 3
again 2
took 1
care 47
to 805
inform 21
him 9
at 272
first 8
that 11
it 67
was 93
a 6799
haunt 9
of 109
hers 9
how 27
it 67
could 2
occur 7
a 6799
second 16
time 45
therefore 1
was 93
very 1
odd 17
yet 4
it 67
did 23
and 51
even 36
a 6799
third 4
it 67
seemed 1
like 22
ill 84
nature 3
or 333
a 6799
voluntary 2
penance 3
for 484
on 86
these 4
occasions 1
it 67
was 93
not 85
merely 1
a 6799
few 6
formal 21
inquiries 1
and 51
an 970
awkward 6
pause 4
and 51
then 5
away 1
but 82
he 962
actually 1
thought 11
it 67
necessary 2
to 805
turn 46
back 182
and 51
walk 25
with 34
her 181
he 962
never 3
said 1
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
nor 102
did 23
she 199
give 15
herself 1
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
talking 1
or 333
of 109
listening 1
much 2
but 82
it 67
struck 1
her 181
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
their 2
third 4
that 11
he 962
was 93
asking 1
some 30
odd 17
unconnected 1
questions 1
about 1
her 181
pleasure 5
in 2719
being 3
at 272
her 181
love 29
of 109
solitary 2
walks 1
and 51
her 181
opinion 4
of 109
mr 5
and 51
mrs 1
happiness 2
and 51
that 11
in 2719
speaking 2
of 109
and 51
her 181
not 85
perfectly 1
understanding 4
the 193
house 87
he 962
seemed 1
to 805
expect 20
that 11
whenever 1
she 199
came 36
into 26
kent 9
again 2
she 199
would 5
be 1200
staying 1
there 21
too 50
his 43
words 5
seemed 1
to 805
imply 2
it 67
could 2
he 962
have 11
colonel 5
in 2719
his 43
thoughts 1
she 199
supposed 2
if 8
he 962
meant 3
anything 3
he 962
must 28
mean 36
an 970
allusion 3
to 805
what 14
might 9
arise 3
in 2719
that 11
quarter 25
it 67
distressed 1
her 181
a 6799
little 6
and 51
she 199
was 93
quite 1
glad 30
to 805
find 10
herself 1
at 272
the 193
gate 25
in 2719
the 193
pales 8
opposite 4
the 193
parsonage 3
she 199
was 93
engaged 1
one 19
day 27
as 509
she 199
walked 1
in 2719
perusing 1
last 7
letter 20
and 51
dwelling 3
on 86
some 30
passages 1
which 2
proved 1
that 11
jane 8
had 11
not 85
written 1
in 2719
spirits 1
when 6
instead 1
of 109
being 3
again 2
surprised 1
by 57
mr 5
darcy 2
she 199
saw 24
on 86
looking 1
up 194
that 11
colonel 5
was 93
meeting 6
her 181
putting 1
away 1
the 193
letter 20
immediately 1
and 51
forcing 1
a 6799
smile 7
she 199
said 1
i 4330
did 23
not 85
know 12
before 2
that 11
you 29
ever 33
walked 1
this 6
way 27
i 4330
have 11
been 1
making 4
the 193
tour 23
of 109
the 193
park 18
he 962
replied 1
as 509
i 4330
generally 1
do 814
every 10
year 19
and 51
intend 6
to 805
close 22
it 67
with 34
a 6799
call 57
at 272
the 193
parsonage 3
are 12
you 29
going 3
much 2
farther 2
no 896
i 4330
should 7
have 11
turned 1
in 2719
a 6799
moment 14
and 51
accordingly 1
she 199
did 23
turn 46
and 51
they 5
walked 1
towards 1
the 193
parsonage 3
together 3
do 814
you 29
certainly 1
leave 14
kent 9
on 86
saturday 3
said 1
she 199
yes 16
if 8
darcy 2
does 5
not 85
put 47
it 67
off 100
again 2
but 82
i 4330
am 392
at 272
his 43
disposal 3
he 962
arranges 1
the 193
business 13
just 24
as 509
he 962
pleases 1
and 51
if 8
not 85
able 3
to 805
please 3
himself 1
in 2719
the 193
arrangement 3
he 962
has 41
at 272
least 3
pleasure 5
in 2719
the 193
great 12
power 19
of 109
choice 5
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
anybody 2
who 79
seems 1
more 11
to 805
enjoy 9
the 193
power 19
of 109
doing 3
what 14
he 962
likes 2
than 22
mr 5
darcy 2
he 962
likes 2
to 805
have 11
his 43
own 9
way 27
very 1
well 24
replied 1
colonel 5
but 82
so 797
we 444
all 162
do 814
it 67
is 124
only 1
that 11
he 962
has 41
better 7
means 1
of 109
having 1
it 67
than 22
many 2
others 1
because 1
he 962
is 124
rich 19
and 51
many 2
others 1
are 12
poor 11
i 4330
speak 12
feelingly 1
a 6799
younger 1
son 70
you 29
know 12
must 28
be 1200
inured 1
to 805
self 11
denial 3
and 51
dependence 2
in 2719
my 90
opinion 4
the 193
younger 1
son 70
of 109
an 970
earl 20
can 287
know 12
very 1
little 6
of 109
either 1
now 10
seriously 1
what 14
have 11
you 29
ever 33
known 1
of 109
self 11
denial 3
and 51
dependence 2
when 6
have 11
you 29
been 1
prevented 1
by 57
want 13
of 109
money 17
from 2
going 3
wherever 1
you 29
chose 2
or 333
procuring 1
anything 3
you 29
had 11
a 6799
fancy 5
for 484
these 4
are 12
home 90
questions 1
and 51
perhaps 1
i 4330
cannot 1
say 7
that 11
i 4330
have 11
experienced 1
many 2
hardships 1
of 109
that 11
nature 3
but 82
in 2719
matters 1
of 109
greater 1
weight 21
i 4330
may 49
suffer 11
from 2
want 13
of 109
money 17
younger 1
sons 2
cannot 1
marry 2
where 21
they 5
like 22
unless 1
where 21
they 5
like 22
women 5
of 109
fortune 8
which 2
i 4330
think 8
they 5
very 1
often 4
do 814
our 3
habits 1
of 109
expense 3
make 17
us 70
too 50
dependent 4
and 51
there 21
are 12
not 85
many 2
in 2719
my 90
rank 19
of 109
life 44
who 79
can 287
afford 6
to 805
marry 2
without 1
some 30
attention 3
to 805
money 17
is 124
this 6
thought 11
elizabeth 5
meant 3
for 484
me 1041
and 51
she 199
at 272
the 193
idea 21
but 82
recovering 1
herself 1
said 1
in 2719
a 6799
lively 1
tone 12
and 51
pray 9
what 14
is 124
the 193
usual 3
price 6
of 109
an 970
earl's 1
younger 1
son 70
unless 1
the 193
elder 7
brother 9
is 124
very 1
sickly 1
i 4330
suppose 4
you 29
would 5
not 85
ask 6
above 3
fifty 2
thousand 7
pounds 1
he 962
answered 1
her 181
in 2719
the 193
same 5
style 4
and 51
the 193
subject 11
dropped 1
to 805
interrupt 11
a 6799
silence 7
which 2
might 9
make 17
him 9
fancy 5
her 181
affected 2
with 34
what 14
had 11
passed 1
she 199
soon 3
afterwards 1
said 1
i 4330
imagine 3
your 4
cousin 3
brought 1
you 29
down 90
with 34
him 9
chiefly 1
for 484
the 193
sake 2
of 109
having 1
someone 3
at 272
his 43
disposal 3
i 4330
wonder 17
he 962
does 5
not 85
marry 2
to 805
secure 6
a 6799
lasting 2
convenience 3
of 109
that 11
kind 31
but 82
perhaps 1
his 43
sister 9
does 5
as 509
well 24
for 484
the 193
present 20
and 51
as 509
she 199
is 124
under 288
his 43
sole 32
care 47
he 962
may 49
do 814
what 14
he 962
likes 2
with 34
her 181
no 896
said 1
colonel 5
that 11
is 124
an 970
advantage 6
which 2
he 962
must 28
divide 10
with 34
me 1041
i 4330
am 392
joined 1
with 34
him 9
in 2719
the 193
guardianship 2
of 109
miss 71
darcy 2
are 12
you 29
indeed 1
and 51
pray 9
what 14
sort 14
of 109
guardians 3
do 814
you 29
make 17
does 5
your 4
charge 8
give 15
you 29
much 2
trouble 18
young 9
ladies 1
of 109
her 181
age 24
are 12
sometimes 1
a 6799
little 6
difficult 5
to 805
manage 15
and 51
if 8
she 199
has 41
the 193
true 9
darcy 2
spirit 20
she 199
may 49
like 22
to 805
have 11
her 181
own 9
way 27
as 509
she 199
spoke 14
she 199
observed 1
him 9
looking 1
at 272
her 181
earnestly 1
and 51
the 193
manner 8
in 2719
which 2
he 962
immediately 1
asked 1
her 181
why 4
she 199
supposed 2
miss 71
darcy 2
likely 1
to 805
give 15
them 9
any 17
uneasiness 2
convinced 1
her 181
that 11
she 199
had 11
somehow 1
or 333
other 5
got 14
pretty 3
near 15
the 193
truth 7
she 199
directly 1
replied 1
you 29
need 29
not 85
be 1200
frightened 1
i 4330
never 3
heard 1
any 17
harm 41
of 109
her 181
and 51
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
she 199
is 124
one 19
of 109
the 193
most 3
tractable 1
creatures 1
in 2719
the 193
world 12
she 199
is 124
a 6799
very 1
great 12
with 34
some 30
ladies 1
of 109
my 90
acquaintance 5
mrs 1
hurst 2
and 51
miss 71
i 4330
think 8
i 4330
have 11
heard 1
you 29
say 7
that 11
you 29
know 12
them 9
i 4330
know 12
them 9
a 6799
little 6
their 2
brother 9
is 124
a 6799
pleasant 9
man 342
he 962
is 124
a 6799
great 12
friend 14
of 109
darcy's 1
oh 17
yes 16
said 1
elizabeth 5
mr 5
darcy 2
is 124
uncommonly 1
kind 31
to 805
mr 5
and 51
takes 1
a 6799
prodigious 2
deal 13
of 109
care 47
of 109
him 9
care 47
of 109
him 9
yes 16
i 4330
really 1
believe 6
darcy 2
does 5
take 18
care 47
of 109
him 9
in 2719
those 1
points 1
where 21
he 962
most 3
wants 1
care 47
from 2
something 3
that 11
he 962
told 1
me 1041
in 2719
our 3
journey 11
hither 2
i 4330
have 11
reason 13
to 805
think 8
very 1
much 2
indebted 3
to 805
him 9
but 82
i 4330
ought 2
to 805
beg 59
his 43
pardon 10
for 484
i 4330
have 11
no 896
right 31
to 805
suppose 4
that 11
was 93
the 193
person 33
meant 3
it 67
was 93
all 162
conjecture 4
what 14
is 124
it 67
you 29
mean 36
it 67
is 124
a 6799
circumstance 4
which 2
darcy 2
could 2
not 85
wish 13
to 805
be 1200
generally 1
known 1
because 1
if 8
it 67
were 5
to 805
get 13
round 29
to 805
the 193
lady's 1
family 2
it 67
would 5
be 1200
an 970
unpleasant 4
thing 15
you 29
may 49
depend 17
upon 1
my 90
not 85
mentioning 1
it 67
and 51
remember 4
that 11
i 4330
have 11
not 85
much 2
reason 13
for 484
supposing 1
it 67
to 805
be 1200
what 14
he 962
told 1
me 1041
was 93
merely 1
this 6
that 11
he 962
congratulated 1
himself 1
on 86
having 1
lately 1
saved 1
a 6799
friend 14
from 2
the 193
inconveniences 1
of 109
a 6799
most 3
imprudent 2
marriage 6
but 82
without 1
mentioning 1
names 4
or 333
any 17
other 5
particulars 1
and 51
i 4330
only 1
suspected 1
it 67
to 805
be 1200
from 2
believing 1
him 9
the 193
kind 31
of 109
young 9
man 342
to 805
get 13
into 26
a 6799
scrape 7
of 109
that 11
sort 14
and 51
from 2
knowing 3
them 9
to 805
have 11
been 1
together 3
the 193
whole 26
of 109
last 7
summer 13
did 23
mr 5
darcy 2
give 15
you 29
reasons 1
for 484
this 6
interference 2
i 4330
understood 1
that 11
there 21
were 5
some 30
very 1
strong 16
objections 1
against 1
the 193
lady 18
and 51
what 14
arts 4
did 23
he 962
use 18
to 805
separate 7
them 9
he 962
did 23
not 85
talk 18
to 805
me 1041
of 109
his 43
own 9
arts 4
said 1
smiling 2
he 962
only 1
told 1
me 1041
what 14
i 4330
have 11
now 10
told 1
you 29
elizabeth 5
made 13
no 896
answer 8
and 51
walked 1
on 86
her 181
heart 57
swelling 3
with 34
indignation 2
after 48
watching 1
her 181
a 6799
little 6
asked 1
her 181
why 4
she 199
was 93
so 797
thoughtful 4
i 4330
am 392
thinking 2
of 109
what 14
you 29
have 11
been 1
telling 2
me 1041
said 1
she 199
your 4
cousin's 1
conduct 21
does 5
not 85
suit 21
my 90
feelings 1
why 4
was 93
he 962
to 805
be 1200
the 193
judge 6
you 29
are 12
rather 2
disposed 1
to 805
call 57
his 43
interference 2
officious 4
i 4330
do 814
not 85
see 70
what 14
right 31
mr 5
darcy 2
had 11
to 805
decide 6
on 86
the 193
propriety 2
of 109
his 43
friend's 1
inclination 3
or 333
why 4
upon 1
his 43
own 9
alone 1
he 962
was 93
to 805
determine 7
and 51
direct 30
in 2719
what 14
manner 8
his 43
friend 14
was 93
to 805
be 1200
happy 1
but 82
she 199
continued 1
recollecting 1
herself 1
as 509
we 444
know 12
none 32
of 109
the 193
particulars 1
it 67
is 124
not 85
fair 25
to 805
condemn 11
him 9
it 67
is 124
not 85
to 805
be 1200
supposed 2
that 11
there 21
was 93
much 2
affection 5
in 2719
the 193
case 25
that 11
is 124
not 85
an 970
unnatural 4
surmise 4
said 1
but 82
it 67
is 124
a 6799
lessening 1
of 109
the 193
of 109
my 90
cousin's 1
triumph 10
very 1
sadly 1
this 6
was 93
spoken 1
jestingly 1
but 82
it 67
appeared 1
to 805
her 181
so 797
just 24
a 6799
picture 8
of 109
mr 5
darcy 2
that 11
she 199
would 5
not 85
trust 26
herself 1
with 34
an 970
answer 8
and 51
therefore 1
abruptly 1
changing 1
the 193
conversation 8
talked 1
on 86
indifferent 2
matters 1
until 1
they 5
reached 1
the 193
parsonage 3
there 21
shut 32
into 26
her 181
own 9
room 22
as 509
soon 3
as 509
their 2
visitor 3
left 19
them 9
she 199
could 2
think 8
without 1
interruption 3
of 109
all 162
that 11
she 199
had 11
heard 1
it 67
was 93
not 85
to 805
be 1200
supposed 2
that 11
any 17
other 5
people 4
could 2
be 1200
meant 3
than 22
those 1
with 34
whom 3
she 199
was 93
connected 1
there 21
could 2
not 85
exist 15
in 2719
the 193
world 12
two 14
men 140
over 596
whom 3
mr 5
darcy 2
could 2
have 11
such 2
boundless 4
influence 4
that 11
he 962
had 11
been 1
concerned 2
in 2719
the 193
measures 1
taken 1
to 805
separate 7
and 51
jane 8
she 199
had 11
never 3
doubted 1
but 82
she 199
had 11
always 1
attributed 1
to 805
miss 71
the 193
principal 7
design 16
and 51
arrangement 3
of 109
them 9
if 8
his 43
own 9
vanity 2
however 1
did 23
not 85
mislead 4
him 9
he 962
was 93
the 193
cause 14
his 43
pride 6
and 51
caprice 3
were 5
the 193
cause 14
of 109
all 162
that 11
jane 8
had 11
suffered 1
and 51
still 13
continued 1
to 805
suffer 11
he 962
had 11
ruined 1
for 484
a 6799
while 4
every 10
hope 16
of 109
happiness 2
for 484
the 193
most 3
affectionate 2
generous 4
heart 57
in 2719
the 193
world 12
and 51
no 896
one 19
could 2
say 7
how 27
lasting 2
an 970
evil 15
he 962
might 9
have 11
inflicted 1
there 21
were 5
some 30
very 1
strong 16
objections 1
against 1
the 193
lady 18
were 5
colonel 5
words 5
and 51
those 1
strong 16
objections 1
probably 1
were 5
her 181
having 1
one 19
uncle 18
who 79
was 93
a 6799
country 12
attorney 3
and 51
another 1
who 79
was 93
in 2719
business 13
in 2719
london 5
to 805
jane 8
herself 1
she 199
exclaimed 1
there 21
could 2
be 1200
no 896
possibility 2
of 109
objection 5
all 162
loveliness 2
and 51
goodness 2
as 509
she 199
is 124
her 181
understanding 4
excellent 2
her 181
mind 25
improved 1
and 51
her 181
manners 1
captivating 1
neither 1
could 2
anything 3
be 1200
urged 1
against 1
my 90
father 12
who 79
though 12
with 34
some 30
peculiarities 1
has 41
abilities 1
mr 5
darcy 2
himself 1
need 29
not 85
disdain 7
and 51
respectability 2
which 2
he 962
will 39
probably 1
never 3
reach 6
when 6
she 199
thought 11
of 109
her 181
mother 21
her 181
confidence 3
gave 4
way 27
a 6799
little 6
but 82
she 199
would 5
not 85
allow 9
that 11
any 17
objections 1
there 21
had 11
material 17
weight 21
with 34
mr 5
darcy 2
whose 1
pride 6
she 199
was 93
convinced 1
would 5
receive 8
a 6799
deeper 1
wound 6
from 2
the 193
want 13
of 109
importance 2
in 2719
his 43
friend's 1
connections 1
than 22
from 2
their 2
want 13
of 109
sense 8
and 51
she 199
was 93
quite 1
decided 2
at 272
last 7
that 11
he 962
had 11
been 1
partly 1
governed 1
by 57
this 6
worst 6
kind 31
of 109
pride 6
and 51
partly 1
by 57
the 193
wish 13
of 109
retaining 1
mr 5
for 484
his 43
sister 9
the 193
agitation 3
and 51
tears 1
which 2
the 193
subject 11
occasioned 1
brought 1
on 86
a 6799
headache 3
and 51
it 67
grew 1
so 797
much 2
worse 6
towards 1
the 193
evening 3
that 11
added 1
to 805
her 181
unwillingness 2
to 805
see 70
mr 5
darcy 2
it 67
determined 2
her 181
not 85
to 805
attend 15
her 181
cousins 1
to 805
where 21
they 5
were 5
engaged 1
to 805
drink 9
tea 99
mrs 1
collins 1
seeing 2
that 11
she 199
was 93
really 1
unwell 1
did 23
not 85
press 30
her 181
to 805
go 500
and 51
as 509
much 2
as 509
possible 3
prevented 1
her 181
husband 10
from 2
pressing 4
her 181
but 82
mr 5
collins 1
could 2
not 85
conceal 10
his 43
apprehension 3
of 109
lady 18
catherine's 1
being 3
rather 2
displeased 1
by 57
her 181
staying 1
at 272
home 90
chapter 3
when 6
they 5
were 5
gone 4
elizabeth 5
as 509
if 8
intending 1
to 805
exasperate 4
herself 1
as 509
much 2
as 509
possible 3
against 1
mr 5
darcy 2
chose 2
for 484
her 181
employment 3
the 193
examination 3
of 109
all 162
the 193
letters 1
which 2
jane 8

since 7
her 181
being 3

kent 9

contained 1
no 896
actual 11
complaint 3
nor 102
was 93
there 21
any 17
revival 8
of 109
past 71
occurrences 1
or 333
any 17
communication 3
of 109
present 20
suffering 3
but 82
in 2719
all 162
and 51
in 2719
almost 1
every 10
line 36
of 109
each 1
there 21
was 93
a 6799
want 13
of 109
that 11
cheerfulness 2
which 2
had 11
been 1
used 1
to 805
her 181
style 4
and 51
which 2
proceeding 3
from 2
the 193
serenity 2
of 109
a 6799
mind 25
at 272
ease 10
with 34
itself 1
and 51
kindly 1
disposed 1
towards 1
everyone 2
had 11
been 1
scarcely 1
ever 33
clouded 1
elizabeth 5
noticed 1
every 10
sentence 4
conveying 1
the 193
idea 21
of 109
uneasiness 2
with 34
an 970
attention 3
which 2
it 67
had 11
hardly 1
received 1
on 86
the 193
first 8
perusal 3
mr 5
darcy's 1
shameful 4
boast 12
of 109
what 14
misery 2
he 962
had 11
been 1
able 3
to 805
inflict 7
gave 4
her 181
a 6799
keener 1
sense 8
of 109
her 181
sister's 1
sufferings 1
it 67
was 93
some 30
consolation 3
to 805
think 8
that 11
his 43
visit 14
to 805
was 93
to 805
end 92
on 86
the 193
day 27
after 48
the 193
next 2
and 51
a 6799
still 13
greater 1
that 11
in 2719
less 19
than 22
a 6799
fortnight 4
she 199
should 7
herself 1
be 1200
with 34
jane 8
again 2
and 51
enabled 1
to 805
contribute 3
to 805
the 193
recovery 2
of 109
her 181
spirits 1
by 57
all 162
that 11
affection 5
could 2
do 814
she 199
could 2
not 85
think 8
of 109
darcy's 1
leaving 3
kent 9
without 1
remembering 1
that 11
his 43
cousin 3
was 93
to 805
go 500
with 34
him 9
but 82
colonel 5
had 11
made 13
it 67
clear 23
that 11
he 962
had 11
no 896
intentions 1
at 272
all 162
and 51
agreeable 3
as 509
he 962
was 93
she 199
did 23
not 85
mean 36
to 805
be 1200
unhappy 1
about 1
him 9
while 4
settling 1
this 6
point 22
she 199
was 93
suddenly 1
roused 1
by 57
the 193
sound 29
of 109
the 193
door 41
bell 66
and 51
her 181
spirits 1
were 5
a 6799
little 6
fluttered 1
by 57
the 193
idea 21
of 109
its 2
being 3
colonel 5
himself 1
who 79
had 11
once 2
before 2
called 1
late 23
in 2719
the 193
evening 3
and 51
might 9
now 10
come 36
to 805
inquire 6
particularly 1
after 48
her 181
but 82
this 6
idea 21
was 93
soon 3
banished 1
and 51
her 181
spirits 1
were 5
very 1
differently 1
affected 2
when 6
to 805
her 181
utter 10
amazement 2
she 199
saw 24
mr 5
darcy 2
walk 25
into 26
the 193
room 22
in 2719
an 970
hurried 2
manner 8
he 962
immediately 1
began 1
an 970
inquiry 2
after 48
her 181
health 12
imputing 1
his 43
visit 14
to 805
a 6799
wish 13
of 109
hearing 3
that 11
she 199
were 5
better 7
she 199
answered 1
him 9
with 34
cold 9
civility 2
he 962
sat 92
down 90
for 484
a 6799
few 6
moments 1
and 51
then 5
getting 1
up 194
walked 1
about 1
the 193
room 22
elizabeth 5
was 93
surprised 1
but 82
said 1
not 85
a 6799
word 26
after 48
a 6799
silence 7
of 109
several 3
minutes 2
he 962
came 36
towards 1
her 181
in 2719
an 970
agitated 1
manner 8
and 51
thus 1
began 1
in 2719
vain 8
i 4330
have 11
struggled 1
it 67
will 39
not 85
do 814
my 90
feelings 1
will 39
not 85
be 1200
repressed 1
you 29
must 28
allow 9
me 1041
to 805
tell 16
you 29
how 27
ardently 1
i 4330
admire 6
and 51
love 29
you 29
elizabeth's 1
astonishment 2
was 93
beyond 1
expression 11
she 199
stared 1
doubted 1
and 51
was 93
silent 6
this 6
he 962
considered 1
sufficient 2
encouragement 3
and 51
the 193
avowal 3
of 109
all 162
that 11
he 962
felt 5
and 51
had 11
long 49
felt 5
for 484
her 181
immediately 1
followed 1
he 962
spoke 14
well 24
but 82
there 21
were 5
feelings 1
besides 1
those 1
of 109
the 193
heart 57
to 805
be 1200
detailed 1
and 51
he 962
was 93
not 85
more 11
eloquent 2
on 86
the 193
subject 11
of 109
tenderness 2
than 22
of 109
pride 6
his 43
sense 8
of 109
her 181
inferiority 2
of 109
its 2
being 3
a 6799
degradation 2
of 109
the 193
family 2
obstacles 1
which 2
had 11
always 1
opposed 1
to 805
inclination 3
were 5
dwelt 1
on 86
with 34
a 6799
warmth 2
which 2
seemed 1
due 21
to 805
the 193
consequence 3
he 962
was 93
wounding 1
but 82
was 93
very 1
unlikely 1
to 805
recommend 8
his 43
suit 21
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
her 181
deeply 1
rooted 1
dislike 4
she 199
could 2
not 85
be 1200
insensible 1
to 805
the 193
compliment 6
of 109
such 2
a 6799
man's 1
affection 5
and 51
though 12
her 181
intentions 1
did 23
not 85
vary 2
for 484
an 970
instant 11
she 199
was 93
at 272
first 8
sorry 1
for 484
the 193
pain 42
he 962
was 93
to 805
receive 8
till 14
roused 1
to 805
resentment 3
by 57
his 43
subsequent 2
language 3
she 199
lost 1
all 162
compassion 4
in 2719
anger 5
she 199
tried 1
however 1
to 805
compose 7
herself 1
to 805
answer 8
him 9
with 34
patience 2
when 6
he 962
should 7
have 11
done 3
he 962
concluded 1
with 34
representing 1
to 805
her 181
the 193
strength 10
of 109
that 11
attachment 3
which 2
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
all 162
his 43
he 962
had 11
found 18
impossible 2
to 805
conquer 8
and 51
with 34
expressing 1
his 43
hope 16
that 11
it 67
would 5
now 10
be 1200
rewarded 1
by 57
her 181
acceptance 3
of 109
his 43
hand 137
as 509
he 962
said 1
this 6
she 199
could 2
easily 1
see 70
that 11
he 962
had 11
no 896
doubt 15
of 109
a 6799
answer 8
he 962
spoke 14
of 109
apprehension 3
and 51
anxiety 2
but 82
his 43
countenance 4
expressed 1
real 47
security 2
such 2
a 6799
circumstance 4
could 2
only 1
exasperate 4
farther 2
and 51
when 6
he 962
ceased 1
the 193
rose 37
into 26
her 181
cheeks 1
and 51
she 199
said 1
in 2719
such 2
cases 1
as 509
this 6
it 67
is 124
i 4330
believe 6
the 193
established 1
mode 57
to 805
express 25
a 6799
sense 8
of 109
obligation 3
for 484
the 193
sentiments 1
avowed 2
however 1
unequally 1
they 5
may 49
be 1200
returned 1
it 67
is 124
natural 18
that 11
obligation 3
should 7
be 1200
felt 5
and 51
if 8
i 4330
could 2
feel 11
gratitude 2
i 4330
would 5
now 10
thank 15
you 29
but 82
i 4330
cannot 1
i 4330
have 11
never 3
desired 1
your 4
good 28
opinion 4
and 51
you 29
have 11
certainly 1
bestowed 1
it 67
most 3
unwillingly 1
i 4330
am 392
sorry 1
to 805
have 11
occasioned 1
pain 42
to 805
anyone 2
it 67
has 41
been 1
most 3
unconsciously 1
done 3
however 1
and 51
i 4330
hope 16
will 39
be 1200
of 109
short 62
duration 2
the 193
feelings 1
which 2
you 29
tell 16
me 1041
have 11
long 49
prevented 1
the 193
acknowledgment 3
of 109
your 4
regard 7
can 287
have 11
little 6
difficulty 2
in 2719
overcoming 1
it 67
after 48
this 6
explanation 3
mr 5
darcy 2
who 79
was 93
leaning 3
against 1
the 193
mantelpiece 3
with 34
his 43
eyes 8
fixed 2
on 86
her 181
face 19
seemed 1
to 805
catch 24
her 181
words 5
with 34
no 896
less 19
resentment 3
than 22
surprise 4
his 43
complexion 5
became 1
pale 41
with 34
anger 5
and 51
the 193
disturbance 3
of 109
his 43
mind 25
was 93
visible 1
in 2719
every 10
feature 5
he 962
was 93
struggling 1
for 484
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
composure 2
and 51
would 5
not 85
open 21
his 43
lips 8
till 14
he 962
believed 1
himself 1
to 805
have 11
attained 1
it 67
the 193
pause 4
was 93
to 805
elizabeth's 1
feelings 1
dreadful 4
at 272
length 14
with 34
a 6799
voice 8
of 109
forced 1
calmness 2
he 962
said 1
and 51
this 6
is 124
all 162
the 193
reply 3
which 2
i 4330
am 392
to 805
have 11
the 193
of 109
expecting 1
i 4330
might 9
perhaps 1
wish 13
to 805
be 1200
informed 1
why 4
with 34
so 797
little 6
at 272
civility 2
i 4330
am 392
thus 1
rejected 1
but 82
it 67
is 124
of 109
small 14
importance 2
i 4330
might 9
as 509
well 24
inquire 6
replied 1
she 199
why 4
with 34
so 797
evident 2
a 6799
desire 6
of 109
offending 1
and 51
insulting 2
me 1041
you 29
chose 2
to 805
tell 16
me 1041
that 11
you 29
liked 1
me 1041
against 1
your 4
will 39
against 1
your 4
reason 13
and 51
even 36
against 1
your 4
character 16
was 93
not 85
this 6
some 30
excuse 4
for 484
incivility 2
if 8
i 4330
was 93
uncivil 3
but 82
i 4330
have 11
other 5
provocations 1
you 29
know 12
i 4330
have 11
had 11
not 85
my 90
feelings 1
decided 2
against 1
you 29
had 11
they 5
been 1
indifferent 2
or 333
had 11
they 5
even 36
been 1
do 814
you 29
think 8
that 11
any 17
consideration 3
would 5
tempt 14
me 1041
to 805
accept 16
the 193
man 342
who 79
has 41
been 1
the 193
means 1
of 109
ruining 1
perhaps 1
for 484
ever 33
the 193
happiness 2
of 109
a 6799
most 3
beloved 3
sister 9
as 509
she 199
pronounced 1
these 4
words 5
mr 5
darcy 2
changed 1
but 82
the 193
emotion 12
was 93
short 62
and 51
he 962
listened 1
without 1
attempting 1
to 805
interrupt 11
her 181
while 4
she 199
continued 1
i 4330
have 11
every 10
reason 13
in 2719
the 193
world 12
to 805
think 8
ill 84
of 109
you 29
no 896
motive 4
can 287
excuse 4
the 193
unjust 5
and 51
ungenerous 1
part 102
you 29
acted 1
there 21
you 29
dare 15
not 85
you 29
cannot 1
deny 2
that 11
you 29
have 11
been 1
the 193
principal 7
if 8
not 85
the 193
only 1
means 1
of 109
dividing 1
them 9
from 2
each 1
other 5
of 109
exposing 1
one 19
to 805
the 193
censure 7
of 109
the 193
world 12
for 484
caprice 3
and 51
instability 2
and 51
the 193
other 5
to 805
its 2
derision 2
for 484
disappointed 1
hopes 1
and 51
involving 1
them 9
both 8
in 2719
misery 2
of 109
the 193
acutest 1
kind 31
she 199
paused 1
and 51
saw 24
with 34
no 896
slight 10
indignation 2
that 11
he 962
was 93
listening 1
with 34
an 970
air 129
which 2
proved 1
him 9
wholly 1
unmoved 1
by 57
any 17
feeling 4
of 109
remorse 8
he 962
even 36
looked 1
at 272
her 181
with 34
a 6799
smile 7
of 109
affected 2
incredulity 2
can 287
you 29
deny 2
that 11
you 29
have 11
done 3
it 67
she 199
repeated 2
with 34
assumed 1
he 962
then 5
replied 1
i 4330
have 11
no 896
wish 13
of 109
denying 1
that 11
i 4330
did 23
everything 2
in 2719
my 90
power 19
to 805
separate 7
my 90
friend 14
from 2
your 4
sister 9
or 333
that 11
i 4330
rejoice 3
in 2719
my 90
success 13
towards 1
him 9
i 4330
have 11
been 1
kinder 7
than 22
towards 1
myself 1
elizabeth 5
disdained 1
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
noticing 1
this 6
civil 15
reflection 3
but 82
its 2
meaning 11
did 23
not 85
escape 10
nor 102
was 93
it 67
likely 1
to 805
conciliate 3
her 181
but 82
it 67
is 124
not 85
merely 1
this 6
affair 3
she 199
continued 1
on 86
which 2
my 90
dislike 4
is 124
founded 1
long 49
before 2
it 67
had 11
taken 1
place 29
my 90
opinion 4
of 109
you 29
was 93
decided 2
your 4
character 16
was 93
unfolded 1
in 2719
the 193
recital 6
which 2
i 4330
received 1
many 2
months 1
ago 15
from 2
mr 5
on 86
this 6
subject 11
what 14
can 287
you 29
have 11
to 805
say 7
in 2719
what 14
imaginary 1
act 69
of 109
friendship 3
can 287
you 29
here 31
defend 10
yourself 1
or 333
under 288
what 14
misrepresentation 3
can 287
you 29
here 31
impose 6
upon 1
others 1
you 29
take 18
an 970
eager 6
interest 6
in 2719
that 11
gentleman's 1
concerns 1
said 1
darcy 2
in 2719
a 6799
less 19
tranquil 13
tone 12
and 51
with 34
a 6799
heightened 1
who 79
that 11
knows 1
what 14
his 43
misfortunes 1
have 11
been 1
can 287
help 23
feeling 4
an 970
interest 6
in 2719
him 9
his 43
misfortunes 1
repeated 2
darcy 2
contemptuously 1
yes 16
his 43
misfortunes 1
have 11
been 1
great 12
indeed 1
and 51
of 109
your 4
infliction 2
cried 1
elizabeth 5
with 34
energy 2
you 29
have 11
reduced 1
him 9
to 805
his 43
present 20
state 41
of 109
poverty 2
comparative 4
poverty 2
you 29
have 11
withheld 1
the 193
advantages 1
which 2
you 29
must 28
know 12
to 805
have 11
been 1
designed 1
for 484
him 9
you 29
have 11
deprived 1
the 193
best 37
years 1
of 109
his 43
life 44
of 109
that 11
independence 2
which 2
was 93
no 896
less 19
his 43
due 21
than 22
his 43
desert 12
you 29
have 11
done 3
all 162
this 6
and 51
yet 4
you 29
can 287
treat 15
the 193
mention 5
of 109
his 43
misfortune 3
with 34
contempt 8
and 51
ridicule 4
and 51
this 6
cried 1
darcy 2
as 509
he 962
walked 1
with 34
quick 25
steps 7
across 1
the 193
room 22
is 124
your 4
opinion 4
of 109
me 1041
this 6
is 124
the 193
estimation 3
in 2719
which 2
you 29
hold 22
me 1041
i 4330
thank 15
you 29
for 484
explaining 1
it 67
so 797
fully 1
my 90
faults 1
according 2
to 805
this 6
calculation 3
are 12
heavy 7
indeed 1
but 82
perhaps 1
added 1
he 962
stopping 1
in 2719
his 43
walk 25
and 51
turning 3
towards 1
her 181
these 4
offenses 1
might 9
have 11
been 1
overlooked 1
had 11
not 85
your 4
pride 6
been 1
hurt 12
by 57
my 90
honest 6
confession 6
of 109
the 193
scruples 1
that 11
had 11
long 49
prevented 1
my 90
forming 1
any 17
serious 4
design 16
these 4
bitter 15
accusations 1
might 9
have 11
been 1
suppressed 1
had 11
i 4330
with 34
greater 1
policy 7
concealed 1
my 90
struggles 1
and 51
flattered 1
you 29
into 26
the 193
belief 3
of 109
my 90
being 3
impelled 1
by 57
unqualified 1
unalloyed 1
inclination 3
by 57
reason 13
by 57
reflection 3
by 57
everything 2
but 82
disguise 4
of 109
every 10
sort 14
is 124
my 90
abhorrence 2
nor 102
am 392
i 4330
ashamed 2
of 109
the 193
feelings 1
i 4330
related 3
they 5
were 5
natural 18
and 51
just 24
could 2
you 29
expect 20
me 1041
to 805
rejoice 3
in 2719
the 193
inferiority 2
of 109
your 4
connections 1
to 805
congratulate 3
myself 1
on 86
the 193
hope 16
of 109
relations 4
whose 1
condition 13
in 2719
life 44
is 124
so 797
decidedly 1
beneath 1
my 90
own 9
elizabeth 5
felt 5
herself 1
growing 1
more 11
angry 1
every 10
moment 14
yet 4
she 199
tried 1
to 805
the 193
utmost 2
to 805
speak 12
with 34
composure 2
when 6
she 199
said 1
you 29
are 12
mistaken 2
mr 5
darcy 2
if 8
you 29
suppose 4
that 11
the 193
mode 57
of 109
your 4
declaration 3
affected 2
me 1041
in 2719
any 17
other 5
way 27
than 22
as 509
it 67
spared 1
me 1041
the 193
concern 6
which 2
i 4330
might 9
have 11
felt 5
in 2719
refusing 1
you 29
had 11
you 29
behaved 1
in 2719
a 6799
more 11
manner 8
she 199
saw 24
him 9
start 13
at 272
this 6
but 82
he 962
said 1
nothing 5
and 51
she 199
continued 1
you 29
could 2
not 85
have 11
made 13
the 193
offer 10
of 109
your 4
hand 137
in 2719
any 17
possible 3
way 27
that 11
would 5
have 11
tempted 1
me 1041
to 805
accept 16
it 67
again 2
his 43
astonishment 2
was 93
obvious 4
and 51
he 962
looked 1
at 272
her 181
with 34
an 970
expression 11
of 109
mingled 1
incredulity 2
and 51
mortification 2
she 199
went 1
on 86
from 2
the 193
very 1
beginning 3
from 2
the 193
first 8
moment 14
i 4330
may 49
almost 1
say 7
of 109
my 90
acquaintance 5
with 34
you 29
your 4
manners 1
impressing 1
me 1041
with 34
the 193
fullest 1
belief 3
of 109
your 4
arrogance 2
your 4
conceit 7
and 51
your 4
selfish 4
disdain 7
of 109
the 193
feelings 1
of 109
others 1
were 5
such 2
as 509
to 805
form 68
the 193
groundwork 2
of 109
disapprobation 2
on 86
which 2
succeeding 1
events 1
have 11
built 1
so 797
immovable 1
a 6799
dislike 4
and 51
i 4330
had 11
not 85
known 1
you 29
a 6799
month 6
before 2
i 4330
felt 5
that 11
you 29
were 5
the 193
last 7
man 342
in 2719
the 193
world 12
whom 3
i 4330
could 2
ever 33
be 1200
prevailed 1
on 86
to 805
marry 2
you 29
have 11
said 1
quite 1
enough 2
madam 5
i 4330
perfectly 1
comprehend 4
your 4
feelings 1
and 51
have 11
now 10
only 1
to 805
be 1200
ashamed 2
of 109
what 14
my 90
own 9
have 11
been 1
forgive 8
me 1041
for 484
having 1
taken 1
up 194
so 797
much 2
of 109
your 4
time 45
and 51
accept 16
my 90
best 37
wishes 1
for 484
your 4
health 12
and 51
happiness 2
and 51
with 34
these 4
words 5
he 962
hastily 1
left 19
the 193
room 22
and 51
elizabeth 5
heard 1
him 9
the 193
next 2
moment 14
open 21
the 193
front 29
door 41
and 51
quit 14
the 193
house 87
the 193
tumult 5
of 109
her 181
mind 25
was 93
now 10
painfully 1
great 12
she 199
knew 1
not 85
how 27
to 805
support 10
herself 1
and 51
from 2
actual 11
weakness 3
sat 92
down 90
and 51
cried 1
for 484
half 23
an 970
hour 10
her 181
astonishment 2
as 509
she 199
reflected 1
on 86
what 14
had 11
passed 1
was 93
increased 1
by 57
every 10
review 8
of 109
it 67
that 11
she 199
should 7
receive 8
an 970
offer 10
of 109
marriage 6
from 2
mr 5
darcy 2
that 11
he 962
should 7
have 11
been 1
in 2719
love 29
with 34
her 181
for 484
so 797
many 2
months 1
so 797
much 2
in 2719
love 29
as 509
to 805
wish 13
to 805
marry 2
her 181
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
all 162
the 193
objections 1
which 2
had 11
made 13
him 9
prevent 13
his 43
friend's 1
marrying 1
her 181
sister 9
and 51
which 2
must 28
appear 7
at 272
least 3
with 34
equal 17
force 10
in 2719
his 43
own 9
case 25
was 93
almost 1
incredible 1
it 67
was 93
gratifying 2
to 805
have 11
inspired 1
unconsciously 1
so 797
strong 16
an 970
affection 5
but 82
his 43
pride 6
his 43
abominable 1
pride 6
his 43
shameless 4
avowal 3
of 109
what 14
he 962
had 11
done 3
with 34
respect 18
to 805
jane 8
his 43
unpardonable 1
assurance 3
in 2719
acknowledging 1
though 12
he 962
could 2
not 85
justify 2
it 67
and 51
the 193
unfeeling 2
manner 8
in 2719
which 2
he 962
had 11
mentioned 1
mr 5
his 43
cruelty 2
towards 1
whom 3
he 962
had 11
not 85
attempted 1
to 805
deny 2
soon 3
overcame 1
the 193
pity 4
which 2
the 193
consideration 3
of 109
his 43
attachment 3
had 11
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
excited 2
she 199
continued 1
in 2719
very 1
agitated 1
reflections 1
till 14
the 193
sound 29
of 109
lady 18
catherine's 1
carriage 5
made 13
her 181
feel 11
how 27
unequal 3
she 199
was 93
to 805
encounter 5
charlotte's 1
observation 4
and 51
hurried 2
her 181
away 1
to 805
her 181
room 22
chapter 3
elizabeth 5
awoke 2
the 193
next 2
morning 3
to 805
the 193
same 5
thoughts 1
and 51
meditations 1
which 2
had 11
at 272
length 14
closed 1
her 181
eyes 8
she 199
could 2
not 85
yet 4
recover 8
from 2
the 193
surprise 4
of 109
what 14
had 11
happened 1
it 67
was 93
impossible 2
to 805
think 8
of 109
anything 3
else 2
and 51
totally 1
indisposed 1
for 484
employment 3
she 199
resolved 1
soon 3
after 48
breakfast 5
to 805
indulge 8
herself 1
in 2719
air 129
and 51
exercise 7
she 199
was 93
proceeding 3
directly 1
to 805
her 181
walk 25
when 6
the 193
recollection 3
of 109
mr 5
darcy's 1
sometimes 1
coming 3
there 21
stopped 1
her 181
and 51
instead 1
of 109
entering 1
the 193
park 18
she 199
turned 1
up 194
the 193
lane 3
which 2
led 11
farther 2
from 2
the 193
turnpike 3
road 38
the 193
park 18
paling 3
was 93
still 13
the 193
boundary 2
on 86
one 19
side 74
and 51
she 199
soon 3
passed 1
one 19
of 109
the 193
gates 1
into 26
the 193
ground 36
after 48
walking 2
two 14
or 333
three 12
times 10
along 3
that 11
part 102
of 109
the 193
lane 3
she 199
was 93
tempted 1
by 57
the 193
pleasantness 2
of 109
the 193
morning 3
to 805
stop 36
at 272
the 193
gates 1
and 51
look 14
into 26
the 193
park 18
the 193
five 5
weeks 2
which 2
she 199
had 11
now 10
passed 1
in 2719
kent 9
had 11
made 13
a 6799
great 12
difference 3
in 2719
the 193
country 12
and 51
every 10
day 27
was 93
adding 1
to 805
the 193
verdure 2
of 109
the 193
early 1
trees 1
she 199
was 93
on 86
the 193
point 22
of 109
continuing 1
her 181
walk 25
when 6
she 199
caught 1
a 6799
glimpse 4
of 109
a 6799
gentleman 3
within 3
the 193
sort 14
of 109
grove 14
which 2
edged 1
the 193
park 18
he 962
was 93
moving 2
that 11
way 27
and 51
fearful 4
of 109
its 2
being 3
mr 5
darcy 2
she 199
was 93
directly 1
retreating 1
but 82
the 193
person 33
who 79
advanced 1
was 93
now 10
near 15
enough 2
to 805
see 70
her 181
and 51
stepping 4
forward 12
with 34
eagerness 2
pronounced 1
her 181
name 17
she 199
had 11
turned 1
away 1
but 82
on 86
hearing 3
herself 1
called 1
though 12
in 2719
a 6799
voice 8
which 2
proved 1
it 67
to 805
be 1200
mr 5
darcy 2
she 199
moved 1
again 2
towards 1
the 193
gate 25
he 962
had 11
by 57
that 11
time 45
reached 1
it 67
also 3
and 51
holding 3
out 365
a 6799
letter 20
which 2
she 199
instinctively 1
took 1
said 1
with 34
a 6799
look 14
of 109
haughty 1
composure 2
i 4330
have 11
been 1
walking 2
in 2719
the 193
grove 14
some 30
time 45
in 2719
the 193
hope 16
of 109
meeting 6
you 29
will 39
you 29
do 814
me 1041
the 193
of 109
reading 3
that 11
letter 20
and 51
then 5
with 34
a 6799
slight 10
bow 58
turned 1
again 2
into 26
the 193
plantation 3
and 51
was 93
soon 3
out 365
of 109
sight 17
with 34
no 896
expectation 3
of 109
pleasure 5
but 82
with 34
the 193
strongest 1
curiosity 2
elizabeth 5
opened 1
the 193
letter 20
and 51
to 805
her 181
still 13
increasing 2
wonder 17
perceived 1
an 970
envelope 7
containing 1
two 14
sheets 1
of 109
letter 20
paper 35
written 1
quite 1
through 4
in 2719
a 6799
very 1
close 22
hand 137
the 193
envelope 7
itself 1
was 93
likewise 1
full 16
pursuing 1
her 181
way 27
along 3
the 193
lane 3
she 199
then 5
began 1
it 67
it 67
was 93
dated 1
from 2
at 272
eight 18
o'clock 1
in 2719
the 193
morning 3
and 51
was 93
as 509
follows 1
be 1200
not 85
alarmed 1
madam 5
on 86
receiving 1
this 6
letter 20
by 57
the 193
apprehension 3
of 109
its 2
containing 1
any 17
repetition 3
of 109
those 1
sentiments 1
or 333
renewal 3
of 109
those 1
offers 1
which 2
were 5
last 7
night 61
so 797
disgusting 2
to 805
you 29
i 4330
write 5
without 1
any 17
intention 5
of 109
paining 1
you 29
or 333
humbling 2
myself 1
by 57
dwelling 3
on 86
wishes 1
which 2
for 484
the 193
happiness 2
of 109
both 8
cannot 1
be 1200
too 50
soon 3
forgotten 1
and 51
the 193
effort 7
which 2
the 193
formation 3
and 51
the 193
perusal 3
of 109
this 6
letter 20
must 28
occasion 7
should 7
have 11
been 1
spared 1
had 11
not 85
my 90
character 16
required 1
it 67
to 805
be 1200
written 1
and 51
read 49
you 29
must 28
therefore 1
pardon 10
the 193
freedom 3
with 34
which 2
i 4330
demand 5
your 4
attention 3
your 4
feelings 1
i 4330
know 12
will 39
bestow 7
it 67
unwillingly 1
but 82
i 4330
demand 5
it 67
of 109
your 4
justice 3
two 14
offenses 1
of 109
a 6799
very 1
different 11
nature 3
and 51
by 57
no 896
means 1
of 109
equal 17
magnitude 3
you 29
last 7
night 61
laid 1
to 805
my 90
charge 8
the 193
first 8
mentioned 1
was 93
that 11
regardless 1
of 109
the 193
sentiments 1
of 109
either 1
i 4330
had 11
detached 1
mr 5
from 2
your 4
sister 9
and 51
the 193
other 5
that 11
i 4330
had 11
in 2719
defiance 2
of 109
various 2
claims 1
in 2719
defiance 2
of 109
and 51
humanity 2
ruined 1
the 193
immediate 4
prosperity 2
and 51
blasted 1
the 193
prospects 1
of 109
mr 5
and 51
wantonly 1
to 805
have 11
thrown 1
off 100
the 193
companion 10
of 109
my 90
youth 7
the 193
acknowledged 1
of 109
my 90
father 12
a 6799
young 9
man 342
who 79
had 11
scarcely 1
any 17
other 5
dependence 2
than 22
on 86
our 3
patronage 3
and 51
who 79
had 11
been 1
brought 1
up 194
to 805
expect 20
its 2
exertion 3
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
depravity 2
to 805
which 2
the 193
separation 3
of 109
two 14
young 9
persons 1
whose 1
affection 5
could 2
be 1200
the 193
growth 3
of 109
only 1
a 6799
few 6
weeks 2
could 2
bear 30
no 896
comparison 3
but 82
from 2
the 193
severity 2
of 109
that 11
blame 12
which 2
was 93
last 7
night 61
so 797
liberally 1
bestowed 1
respecting 1
each 1
circumstance 4

shall 12
hope 16
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
the 193
future 3
secured 1
when 6
the 193
following 3
account 14
of 109
my 90
actions 1

their 2
motives 1
has 41
been 1
read 49
if 8

them 9

is 124
due 21
to 805
myself 1

am 392
under 288
the 193
necessity 2
of 109
relating 1
feelings 1
which 2
may 49
be 1200
offensive 6
to 805
yours 3
i 4330
can 287
only 1
say 7
that 11
i 4330
am 392
sorry 1
the 193
necessity 2
must 28
be 1200
obeyed 1
and 51
further 8
apology 2
would 5
be 1200
absurd 9
i 4330
had 11
not 85
been 1
long 49
in 2719
before 2
i 4330
saw 24
in 2719
common 23
with 34
others 1
that 11
preferred 1
your 4
elder 7
sister 9
to 805
any 17
other 5
young 9
woman 21
in 2719
the 193
country 12
but 82
it 67
was 93
not 85
till 14
the 193
evening 3
of 109
the 193
dance 7
at 272
that 11
i 4330
had 11
any 17
apprehension 3
of 109
his 43
feeling 4
a 6799
serious 4
attachment 3
i 4330
had 11
often 4
seen 1
him 9
in 2719
love 29
before 2
at 272
that 11
ball 77
while 4
i 4330
had 11
the 193
of 109
dancing 2
with 34
you 29
i 4330
was 93
first 8
made 13
acquainted 1
by 57
sir 22
william 3
accidental 4
information 3
that 11
attentions 1
to 805
your 4
sister 9
had 11
given 3
rise 7
to 805
a 6799
general 22
expectation 3
of 109
their 2
marriage 6
he 962
spoke 14
of 109
it 67
as 509
a 6799
certain 5
event 18
of 109
which 2
the 193
time 45
alone 1
could 2
be 1200
undecided 3
from 2
that 11
moment 14
i 4330
observed 1
my 90
friend's 1
attentively 1
and 51
i 4330
could 2
then 5
perceive 3
that 11
his 43
partiality 2
for 484
miss 71
bennet 1
was 93
beyond 1
what 14
i 4330
had 11
ever 33
witnessed 1
in 2719
him 9
your 4
sister 9
i 4330
also 3
watched 1
her 181
look 14
and 51
manners 1
were 5
open 21
cheerful 6
and 51
engaging 2
as 509
ever 33
but 82
without 1
any 17
symptom 5
of 109
peculiar 5
regard 7
and 51
i 4330
remained 1
convinced 1
from 2
the 193
evening's 1
scrutiny 2
that 11
though 12
she 199
received 1
his 43
attentions 1
with 34
pleasure 5
she 199
did 23
not 85
invite 7
them 9
by 57
any 17
participation 2
of 109
sentiment 18
if 8
you 29
have 11
not 85
been 1
mistaken 2
here 31
i 4330
must 28
have 11
been 1
in 2719
error 3
your 4
superior 5
knowledge 4
of 109
your 4
sister 9
must 28
make 17
the 193
latter 3
probable 3
if 8
it 67
be 1200
so 797
if 8
i 4330
have 11
been 1
misled 1
by 57
such 2
error 3
to 805
inflict 7
pain 42
on 86
her 181
your 4
resentment 3
has 41
not 85
been 1
unreasonable 3
but 82
i 4330
shall 12
not 85
scruple 4
to 805
assert 11
that 11
the 193
serenity 2
of 109
your 4
sister's 1
countenance 4
and 51
air 129
was 93
such 2
as 509
might 9
have 11
given 3
the 193
most 3
acute 8
observer 3
a 6799
conviction 3
that 11
however 1
amiable 1
her 181
temper 22
her 181
heart 57
was 93
not 85
likely 1
to 805
be 1200
easily 1
touched 1
that 11
i 4330
was 93
desirous 1
of 109
believing 1
her 181
indifferent 2
is 124
certain 5
but 82
i 4330
will 39
venture 8
to 805
say 7
that 11
my 90
investigation 3
and 51
decisions 1
are 12
not 85
usually 1
influenced 1
by 57
my 90
hopes 1
or 333
fears 2
i 4330
did 23
not 85
believe 6
her 181
to 805
be 1200
indifferent 2
because 1
i 4330
wished 1
it 67
i 4330
believed 1
it 67
on 86
impartial 4
conviction 3
as 509
truly 1
as 509
i 4330
wished 1
it 67
in 2719
reason 13
my 90
objections 1
to 805
the 193
marriage 6
were 5
not 85
merely 1
those 1
which 2
i 4330
last 7
night 61
acknowledged 1
to 805
have 11
the 193
utmost 2
force 10
of 109
passion 9
to 805
put 47
aside 3
in 2719
my 90
own 9
case 25
the 193
want 13
of 109
connection 3
could 2
not 85
be 1200
so 797
great 12
an 970
evil 15
to 805
my 90
friend 14
as 509
to 805
me 1041
but 82
there 21
were 5
other 5
causes 1
of 109
repugnance 2
causes 1
which 2
though 12
still 13
existing 1
and 51
existing 1
to 805
an 970
equal 17
degree 3
in 2719
both 8
instances 1
i 4330
had 11
myself 1
to 805
forget 8
because 1
they 5
were 5
not 85
immediately 1
before 2
me 1041
these 4
causes 1
must 28
be 1200
stated 1
though 12
briefly 1
the 193
situation 3
of 109
your 4
mother's 1
family 2
though 12
objectionable 1
was 93
nothing 5
in 2719
comparison 3
to 805
that 11
total 17
want 13
of 109
propriety 2
so 797
frequently 1
so 797
almost 1
uniformly 1
betrayed 1
by 57
herself 1
by 57
your 4
three 12
younger 1
sisters 1
and 51
occasionally 1
even 36
by 57
your 4
father 12
pardon 10
me 1041
it 67
pains 4
me 1041
to 805
offend 7
you 29
but 82
your 4
concern 6
for 484
the 193
defects 1
of 109
your 4
nearest 1
relations 4
and 51
your 4
displeasure 2
at 272
this 6
representation 4
of 109
them 9
let 50
it 67
give 15
you 29
consolation 3
to 805
consider 13
that 11
to 805
have 11
conducted 1
yourselves 1
so 797
as 509
to 805
avoid 8
any 17
share 22
of 109
the 193
like 22
censure 7
is 124
praise 7
no 896
less 19
generally 1
bestowed 1
on 86
you 29
and 51
your 4
elder 7
sister 9
than 22
it 67
is 124
to 805
the 193
sense 8
and 51
disposition 3
of 109
both 8
i 4330
will 39
only 1
say 7
farther 2
that 11
from 2
what 14
passed 1
that 11
evening 3
my 90
opinion 4
of 109
all 162
parties 1
was 93
confirmed 1
and 51
every 10
inducement 3
heightened 1
which 2
could 2
have 11
led 11
me 1041
before 2
to 805
preserve 7
my 90
friend 14
from 2
what 14
i 4330
esteemed 1
a 6799
most 3
unhappy 1
connection 3
he 962
left 19
for 484
london 5
on 86
the 193
day 27
following 3
as 509
you 29
i 4330
am 392
certain 5
remember 4
with 34
the 193
design 16
of 109
soon 3
returning 1
the 193
part 102
which 2
i 4330
acted 1
is 124
now 10
to 805
be 1200
explained 1
his 43
uneasiness 2
had 11
been 1
equally 1
excited 2
with 34
my 90
own 9
our 3
coincidence 3
of 109
feeling 4
was 93
soon 3
discovered 1
and 51
alike 1
sensible 3
that 11
no 896
time 45
was 93
to 805
be 1200
lost 1
in 2719
detaching 1
their 2
brother 9
we 444
shortly 1
resolved 1
on 86
joining 1
him 9
directly 1
in 2719
london 5
we 444
accordingly 1
went 1
and 51
there 21
i 4330
readily 1
engaged 1
in 2719
the 193
office 11
of 109
pointing 1
out 365
to 805
my 90
friend 14
the 193
certain 5
evils 1
of 109
such 2
a 6799
choice 5
i 4330
described 1
and 51
enforced 1
them 9
earnestly 1
but 82
however 1
this 6
remonstrance 3
might 9
have 11
staggered 1
or 333
delayed 1
his 43
determination 3
i 4330
do 814
not 85
suppose 4
that 11
it 67
would 5
ultimately 1
have 11
prevented 1
the 193
marriage 6
had 11
it 67
not 85
been 1
seconded 1
by 57
the 193
assurance 3
that 11
i 4330
hesitated 1
not 85
in 2719
giving 2
of 109
your 4
sister's 1
indifference 2
he 962
had 11
before 2
believed 1
her 181
to 805
return 14
his 43
affection 5
with 34
sincere 4
if 8
not 85
with 34
equal 17
regard 7
but 82
has 41
great 12
natural 18
modesty 2
with 34
a 6799
stronger 1
dependence 2
on 86
my 90
than 22
on 86
his 43
own 9
to 805
convince 3
him 9
therefore 1
that 11
he 962
had 11
deceived 1
himself 1
was 93
no 896
very 1
difficult 5
point 22
to 805
persuade 6
him 9
against 1
returning 1
into 26
when 6
that 11
conviction 3
had 11
been 1
given 3
was 93
scarcely 1
the 193
work 87
of 109
a 6799
moment 14
i 4330
cannot 1
blame 12
myself 1
for 484
having 1
done 3
thus 1
much 2
there 21
is 124
but 82
one 19
part 102
of 109
my 90
conduct 21
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
affair 3
on 86
which 2
i 4330
do 814
not 85
reflect 12
with 34
satisfaction 3
it 67
is 124
that 11
i 4330
condescended 1
to 805
adopt 12
the 193
measures 1
of 109
art 104
so 797
far 91
as 509
to 805
conceal 10
from 2
him 9
your 4
sister's 1
being 3
in 2719
town 27
i 4330
knew 1
it 67
myself 1
as 509
it 67
was 93
known 1
to 805
miss 71
but 82
her 181
brother 9
is 124
even 36
yet 4
ignorant 2
of 109
it 67
that 11
they 5
might 9
have 11
met 180
without 1
ill 84
consequence 3
is 124
perhaps 1
probable 3
but 82
his 43
regard 7
did 23
not 85
appear 7
to 805
me 1041
enough 2
extinguished 1
for 484
him 9
to 805
see 70
her 181
without 1
some 30
danger 7
perhaps 1
this 6
concealment 2
this 6
disguise 4
was 93
beneath 1
me 1041
it 67
is 124
done 3
however 1
and 51
it 67
was 93
done 3
for 484
the 193
best 37
on 86
this 6
subject 11
i 4330
have 11
nothing 5
more 11
to 805
say 7
no 896
other 5
apology 2
to 805
offer 10
if 8
i 4330
have 11
wounded 1
your 4
sister's 1
feelings 1
it 67
was 93
unknowingly 1
done 3
and 51
though 12
the 193
motives 1
which 2
governed 1
me 1041
may 49
to 805
you 29
very 1
naturally 1
appear 7
insufficient 2
i 4330
have 11
not 85
yet 4
to 805
condemn 11
them 9
with 34
respect 18
to 805
that 11
other 5
more 11
weighty 1
accusation 3
of 109
having 1
injured 1
mr 5
i 4330
can 287
only 1
refute 6
it 67
by 57
laying 1
before 2
you 29
the 193
whole 26
of 109
his 43
connection 3
with 34
my 90
family 2
of 109
what 14
he 962
has 41
particularly 1
accused 1
me 1041
i 4330
am 392
ignorant 2
but 82
of 109
the 193
truth 7
of 109
what 14
i 4330
shall 12
relate 8
i 4330
can 287
summon 11
more 11
than 22
one 19
witness 5
of 109
undoubted 2
veracity 2
mr 5
is 124
the 193
son 70
of 109
a 6799
very 1
respectable 1
man 342
who 79
had 11
for 484
many 2
years 1
the 193
management 3
of 109
all 162
the 193
estates 1
and 51
whose 1
good 28
conduct 21
in 2719
the 193
discharge 4
of 109
his 43
trust 26
naturally 1
inclined 1
my 90
father 12
to 805
be 1200
of 109
service 13
to 805
him 9
and 51
on 86
george 6
who 79
was 93
his 43
godson 3
his 43
kindness 3
was 93
therefore 1
liberally 1
bestowed 1
my 90
father 12
supported 1
him 9
at 272
school 54
and 51
afterwards 1
at 272
cambridge 2
most 3
important 2
assistance 2
as 509
his 43
own 9
father 12
always 1
poor 11
from 2
the 193
extravagance 3
of 109
his 43
wife 6
would 5
have 11
been 1
unable 1
to 805
give 15
him 9
a 6799
gentleman's 1
education 9
my 90
father 12
was 93
not 85
only 1
fond 17
of 109
this 6
young 9
man's 1
society 2
whose 1
manners 1
were 5
always 1
engaging 2
he 962
had 11
also 3
the 193
highest 1
opinion 4
of 109
him 9
and 51
hoping 1
the 193
church 21
would 5
be 1200
his 43
profession 14
intended 3
to 805
provide 13
for 484
him 9
in 2719
it 67
as 509
for 484
myself 1
it 67
is 124
many 2
many 2
years 1
since 7
i 4330
first 8
began 1
to 805
think 8
of 109
him 9
in 2719
a 6799
very 1
different 11
manner 8
the 193
vicious 4
propensities 1
the 193
want 13
of 109
principle 4
which 2
he 962
was 93
careful 6
to 805
guard 26
from 2
the 193
knowledge 4
of 109
his 43
best 37
friend 14
could 2
not 85
escape 10
the 193
observation 4
of 109
a 6799
young 9
man 342
of 109
nearly 1
the 193
same 5
age 24
with 34
himself 1
and 51
who 79
had 11
opportunities 1
of 109
seeing 2
him 9
in 2719
unguarded 1
moments 1
which 2
mr 5
darcy 2
could 2
not 85
have 11
here 31
again 2
i 4330
shall 12
give 15
you 29
pain 42
to 805
what 14
degree 3
you 29
only 1
can 287
tell 16
but 82
whatever 1
may 49
be 1200
the 193
sentiments 1
which 2
mr 5
has 41
created 1
a 6799
suspicion 3
of 109
their 2
nature 3
shall 12
not 85
prevent 13
me 1041
from 2
unfolding 1
his 43
real 47
character 16
it 67
adds 1
even 36
another 1
motive 4
my 90
excellent 2
father 12
died 1
about 1
five 5
years 1
ago 15
and 51
his 43
attachment 3
to 805
mr 5
was 93
to 805
the 193
last 7
so 797
steady 3
that 11
in 2719
his 43
will 39
he 962
particularly 1
recommended 1
it 67
to 805
me 1041
to 805
promote 6
his 43
advancement 3
in 2719
the 193
best 37
manner 8
that 11
his 43
profession 14
might 9
allow 9
and 51
if 8
he 962
took 1
orders 1
desired 1
that 11
a 6799
valuable 3
family 2
living 5
might 9
be 1200
his 43
as 509
soon 3
as 509
it 67
became 1
vacant 2
there 21
was 93
also 3
a 6799
legacy 2
of 109
one 19
thousand 7
pounds 1
his 43
own 9
father 12
did 23
not 85
long 49
survive 3
mine 26
and 51
within 3
half 23
a 6799
year 19
from 2
these 4
events 1
mr 5
wrote 1
to 805
inform 21
me 1041
that 11
having 1
finally 1
resolved 1
against 1
taking 4
orders 1
he 962
hoped 1
i 4330
should 7
not 85
think 8
it 67
unreasonable 3
for 484
him 9

of 109
the 193
preferment 2
by 57
which 2
he 962
could 2
not 85

benefited 1
he 962
had 11
some 30
intention 5
he 962
added 1
of 109
studying 1
law 45
and 51
i 4330
must 28
be 1200
aware 3
that 11
the 193
interest 6
of 109
one 19
thousand 7
pounds 1
would 5
be 1200
a 6799
very 1
insufficient 2
support 10
therein 1
i 4330
rather 2
wished 1
than 22
believed 1
him 9
to 805
be 1200
sincere 4
but 82
at 272
any 17
rate 9
was 93
perfectly 1
ready 2
to 805
accede 3
to 805
his 43
proposal 3
i 4330
knew 1
that 11
mr 5

not 85
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
clergyman 2
the 193
business 13
was 93
therefore 1
soon 3
settled 1
he 962
resigned 2
all 162
claim 12
to 805
assistance 2
in 2719
the 193
church 21
were 5
it 67
possible 3
that 11
he 962
could 2
ever 33
be 1200
in 2719
a 6799
situation 3
to 805
receive 8
it 67
and 51
accepted 1
in 2719
return 14
three 12
thousand 7
pounds 1
all 162
connection 3
between 1
us 70
seemed 1
now 10
dissolved 1
i 4330
thought 11
too 50
ill 84
of 109
him 9
to 805
invite 7
him 9
to 805
or 333
admit 7
his 43
society 2
in 2719
town 27
in 2719
town 27
i 4330
believe 6
he 962
chiefly 1
lived 1
but 82
his 43
studying 1
the 193
law 45
was 93
a 6799
mere 10
and 51
being 3
now 10
free 93
from 2
all 162
restraint 3
his 43
life 44
was 93
a 6799
life 44
of 109
idleness 2
and 51
dissipation 2
for 484
about 1
three 12
years 1
i 4330
heard 1
little 6
of 109
him 9
but 82
on 86
the 193
decease 5
of 109
the 193
incumbent 3
of 109
the 193
living 5
which 2
had 11
been 1
designed 1
for 484
him 9
he 962
applied 1
to 805
me 1041
again 2
by 57
letter 20
for 484
the 193
presentation 3
his 43
circumstances 1
he 962
assured 4
me 1041
and 51
i 4330
had 11
no 896
difficulty 2
in 2719
believing 1
it 67
were 5
exceedingly 1
bad 33
he 962
had 11
found 18
the 193
law 45
a 6799
most 3
unprofitable 1
study 3
and 51
was 93
now 10
absolutely 1
resolved 1
on 86
being 3
ordained 1
if 8
i 4330
would 5
present 20
him 9
to 805
the 193
living 5
in 2719
question 16
of 109
which 2
he 962
trusted 1
there 21
could 2
be 1200
little 6
doubt 15
as 509
he 962
was 93
well 24
assured 4
that 11
i 4330
had 11
no 896
other 5
person 33
to 805
provide 13
for 484
and 51
i 4330
could 2
not 85
have 11
forgotten 1
my 90
revered 1
father's 1
intentions 1
you 29
will 39
hardly 1
blame 12
me 1041
for 484
refusing 1
to 805
comply 2
with 34
this 6
entreaty 2
or 333
for 484
resisting 1
every 10
repetition 3
to 805
it 67
his 43
resentment 3
was 93
in 2719
proportion 11
to 805
the 193
distress 7
of 109
his 43
circumstances 1
and 51
he 962
was 93
doubtless 2
as 509
violent 2
in 2719
his 43
abuse 7
of 109
me 1041
to 805
others 1
as 509
in 2719
his 43
reproaches 1
to 805
myself 1
after 48
this 6
period 16
every 10
appearance 3
of 109
acquaintance 5
was 93
dropped 1
how 27
he 962
lived 1
i 4330
know 12
not 85
but 82
last 7
summer 13
he 962
was 93
again 2
most 3
painfully 1
obtruded 1
on 86
my 90
notice 8
i 4330
must 28
now 10
mention 5
a 6799
circumstance 4
which 2
i 4330
would 5
wish 13
to 805
forget 8
myself 1
and 51
which 2
no 896
obligation 3
less 19
than 22
the 193
present 20
should 7
induce 9
me 1041
to 805
unfold 4
to 805
any 17
human 41
being 3
having 1
said 1
thus 1
much 2
i 4330
feel 11
no 896
doubt 15
of 109
your 4
secrecy 2
my 90
sister 9
who 79
is 124
more 11
than 22
ten 151
years 1
my 90
junior 3
was 93
left 19
to 805
the 193
guardianship 2
of 109
my 90
mother's 1
nephew 3
colonel 5
and 51
myself 1
about 1
a 6799
year 19
ago 15
she 199
was 93
taken 1
from 2
school 54
and 51
an 970
establishment 3
formed 1
for 484
her 181
in 2719
london 5
and 51
last 7
summer 13
she 199
went 1
with 34
the 193
lady 18
who 79
presided 1
over 596
it 67
to 805
and 51
thither 1
also 3
went 1
mr 5
undoubtedly 1
by 57
design 16
for 484
there 21
proved 1
to 805
have 11
been 1
a 6799
prior 17
acquaintance 5
between 1
him 9
and 51
mrs 1
younge 2
in 2719
whose 1
character 16
we 444
were 5
most 3
unhappily 1
deceived 1
and 51
by 57
her 181
connivance 2
and 51
aid 12
he 962
so 797
far 91
recommended 1
himself 1
to 805
whose 1
affectionate 2
heart 57
retained 1
a 6799
strong 16
impression 12
of 109
his 43
kindness 3
to 805
her 181
as 509
a 6799
child 28
that 11
she 199
was 93
persuaded 1
to 805
believe 6
herself 1
in 2719
love 29
and 51
to 805
consent 5
to 805
an 970
elopement 3
she 199
was 93
then 5
but 82
fifteen 6
which 2
must 28
be 1200
her 181
excuse 4
and 51
after 48
stating 1
her 181
imprudence 2
i 4330
am 392
happy 1
to 805
add 54
that 11
i 4330
owed 1
the 193
knowledge 4
of 109
it 67
to 805
herself 1
i 4330
joined 1
them 9
unexpectedly 1
a 6799
day 27
or 333
two 14
before 2
the 193
intended 3
elopement 3
and 51
then 5
unable 1
to 805
support 10
the 193
idea 21
of 109
grieving 1
and 51
offending 1
a 6799
brother 9
whom 3
she 199
almost 1
looked 1
up 194
to 805
as 509
a 6799
father 12
acknowledged 1
the 193
whole 26
to 805
me 1041
you 29
may 49
imagine 3
what 14
i 4330
felt 5
and 51
how 27
i 4330
acted 1
regard 7
for 484
my 90
sister's 1
credit 12
and 51
feelings 1
prevented 1
any 17
public 18
exposure 3
but 82
i 4330
wrote 1
to 805
mr 5
who 79
left 19
the 193
place 29
immediately 1
and 51
mrs 1
younge 2
was 93
of 109
course 10
removed 1
from 2
her 181
charge 8
mr 5
chief 14
object 26
was 93
unquestionably 1
my 90
sister's 1
fortune 8
which 2
is 124
thirty 2
thousand 7
pounds 1
but 82
i 4330
cannot 1
help 23
supposing 1
that 11
the 193
hope 16
of 109
revenging 1
himself 1
on 86
me 1041
was 93
a 6799
strong 16
inducement 3
his 43
revenge 6
would 5
have 11
been 1
complete 8
indeed 1
this 6
madam 5
is 124
a 6799
faithful 6
narrative 3
of 109
every 10
event 18
in 2719
which 2
we 444
have 11
been 1
concerned 2
together 3
and 51
if 8
you 29
do 814
not 85
absolutely 1
reject 8
it 67
as 509
false 12
you 29
will 39
i 4330
hope 16
acquit 7
me 1041
henceforth 1
of 109
cruelty 2
towards 1
mr 5
i 4330
know 12
not 85
in 2719
what 14
manner 8
under 288
what 14
form 68
of 109
falsehood 3
he 962
had 11
imposed 1
on 86
you 29
but 82
his 43
success 13
is 124
not 85
perhaps 1
to 805
be 1200
wondered 1
at 272
ignorant 2
as 509
you 29
previously 1
were 5
of 109
everything 2
concerning 1
either 1
detection 2
could 2
not 85
be 1200
in 2719
your 4
power 19
and 51
suspicion 3
certainly 1
not 85
in 2719
your 4
inclination 3
you 29
may 49
possibly 1
wonder 17
why 4
all 162
this 6
was 93
not 85
told 1
you 29
last 7
night 61
but 82
i 4330
was 93
not 85
then 5
master 28
enough 2
of 109
myself 1
to 805
know 12
what 14
could 2
or 333
ought 2
to 805
be 1200
revealed 1
for 484
the 193
truth 7
of 109
everything 2
here 31
related 3
i 4330
can 287
appeal 6
more 11
particularly 1
to 805
the 193
testimony 2
of 109
colonel 5
who 79
from 2
our 3
near 15
relationship 3
and 51
constant 7
intimacy 2
and 51
still 13
more 11
as 509
one 19
of 109
the 193
executors 1
of 109
my 90
father's 1
will 39
has 41
been 1
unavoidably 1
acquainted 1
with 34
every 10
particular 13
of 109
these 4
transactions 1
if 8
your 4
abhorrence 2
of 109
me 1041
should 7
make 17
my 90
assertions 1
valueless 1
you 29
cannot 1
be 1200
prevented 1
by 57
the 193
same 5
cause 14
from 2
confiding 2
in 2719
my 90
cousin 3
and 51
that 11
there 21
may 49
be 1200
the 193
possibility 2
of 109
consulting 1
him 9
i 4330
shall 12
to 805
find 10
some 30
opportunity 2
of 109
putting 1
this 6
letter 20
in 2719
your 4
hands 24
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
the 193
morning 3
i 4330
will 39
only 1
add 54
god 61
bless 9
you 29
darcy 2
chapter 3
if 8
elizabeth 5
when 6
mr 5
darcy 2
gave 4
her 181
the 193
letter 20
did 23
not 85
expect 20
it 67
to 805
contain 16
a 6799
renewal 3
of 109
his 43
offers 1
she 199
had 11
formed 1
no 896
expectation 3
at 272
all 162
of 109
its 2
contents 1
but 82
such 2
as 509
they 5
were 5
it 67
may 49
well 24
be 1200
supposed 2
how 27
eagerly 1
she 199
went 1
through 4
them 9
and 51
what 14
a 6799
contrariety 2
of 109
emotion 12
they 5
excited 2
her 181
feelings 1
as 509
she 199
read 49
were 5
scarcely 1
to 805
be 1200
defined 1
with 34
amazement 2
did 23
she 199
first 8
understand 8
that 11
he 962
believed 1
any 17
apology 2
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
his 43
power 19
and 51
steadfastly 1
was 93
she 199
persuaded 1
that 11
he 962
could 2
have 11
no 896
explanation 3
to 805
give 15
which 2
a 6799
just 24
sense 8
of 109
shame 14
would 5
not 85
conceal 10
with 34
a 6799
strong 16
prejudice 4
against 1
everything 2
he 962
might 9
say 7
she 199
began 1
his 43
account 14
of 109
what 14
had 11
happened 1
at 272
she 199
read 49
with 34
an 970
eagerness 2
which 2
hardly 1
left 19
her 181
power 19
of 109
comprehension 3
and 51
from 2
impatience 3
of 109
knowing 3
what 14
the 193
next 2
sentence 4
might 9
bring 6
was 93
incapable 1
of 109
attending 1
to 805
the 193
sense 8
of 109
the 193
one 19
before 2
her 181
eyes 8
his 43
belief 3
of 109
her 181
sister's 1
insensibility 2
she 199
instantly 1
resolved 1
to 805
be 1200
false 12
and 51
his 43
account 14
of 109
the 193
real 47
the 193
worst 6
objections 1
to 805
the 193
match 25
made 13
her 181
too 50
angry 1
to 805
have 11
any 17
wish 13
of 109
doing 3
him 9
justice 3
he 962
expressed 1
no 896
regret 9
for 484
what 14
he 962
had 11
done 3
which 2
satisfied 1
her 181
his 43
style 4
was 93
not 85
penitent 8
but 82
haughty 1
it 67
was 93
all 162
pride 6
and 51
insolence 2
but 82
when 6
this 6
subject 11
was 93
succeeded 1
by 57
his 43
account 14
of 109
mr 5
when 6
she 199
read 49
with 34
somewhat 2
clearer 1
attention 3
a 6799
relation 7
of 109
events 1
which 2
if 8
true 9
must 28
overthrow 5
every 10
cherished 1
opinion 4
of 109
his 43
worth 15
and 51
which 2
bore 13
so 797
alarming 2
an 970
affinity 2
to 805
his 43
own 9
history 2
of 109
himself 1
her 181
feelings 1
were 5
yet 4
more 11
acutely 1
painful 6
and 51
more 11
difficult 5
of 109
definition 3
astonishment 2
apprehension 3
and 51
even 36
horror 3
oppressed 1
her 181
she 199
wished 1
to 805
discredit 7
it 67
entirely 1
repeatedly 1
exclaiming 1
this 6
must 28
be 1200
false 12
this 6
cannot 1
be 1200
this 6
must 28
be 1200
the 193
grossest 1
falsehood 3
and 51
when 6
she 199
had 11
gone 4
through 4
the 193
whole 26
letter 20
though 12
scarcely 1
knowing 3
anything 3
of 109
the 193
last 7
page 15
or 333
two 14
put 47
it 67
hastily 1
away 1
protesting 1
that 11
she 199
would 5
not 85
regard 7
it 67
that 11
she 199
would 5
never 3
look 14
in 2719
it 67
again 2
in 2719
this 6
perturbed 1
state 41
of 109
mind 25
with 34
thoughts 1
that 11
could 2
rest 110
on 86
nothing 5
she 199
walked 1
on 86
but 82
it 67
would 5
not 85
do 814
in 2719
half 23
a 6799
minute 12
the 193
letter 20
was 93
unfolded 1
again 2
and 51
collecting 1
herself 1
as 509
well 24
as 509
she 199
could 2
she 199
again 2
began 1
the 193
mortifying 1
perusal 3
of 109
all 162
that 11
related 3
to 805
and 51
commanded 1
herself 1
so 797
far 91
as 509
to 805
examine 6
the 193
meaning 11
of 109
every 10
sentence 4
the 193
account 14
of 109
his 43
connection 3
with 34
the 193
family 2
was 93
exactly 1
what 14
he 962
had 11
related 3
himself 1
and 51
the 193
kindness 3
of 109
the 193
late 23
mr 5
darcy 2
though 12
she 199
had 11
not 85
before 2
known 1
its 2
extent 3
agreed 1
equally 1
well 24
with 34
his 43
own 9
words 5
so 797
far 91
each 1
recital 6
confirmed 1
the 193
other 5
but 82
when 6
she 199
came 36
to 805
the 193
will 39
the 193
difference 3
was 93
great 12
what 14
had 11
said 1
of 109
the 193
living 5
was 93
fresh 22
in 2719
her 181
memory 2
and 51
as 509
she 199
recalled 1
his 43
very 1
words 5
it 67
was 93
impossible 2
not 85
to 805
feel 11
that 11
there 21
was 93
gross 10
duplicity 2
on 86
one 19
side 74
or 333
the 193
other 5
and 51
for 484
a 6799
few 6
moments 1
she 199
flattered 1
herself 1
that 11
her 181
wishes 1
did 23
not 85
err 22
but 82
when 6
she 199
read 49
and 51
re 3833
read 49
with 34
the 193
closest 1
attention 3
the 193
particulars 1
immediately 1
following 3
of 109
resigning 1
all 162
pretensions 1
to 805
the 193
living 5
of 109
his 43
receiving 1
in 2719
lieu 8
so 797
considerable 1
a 6799
sum 70
as 509
three 12
thousand 7
pounds 1
again 2
was 93
she 199
forced 1
to 805
hesitate 3
she 199
put 47
down 90
the 193
letter 20
weighed 1
every 10
circumstance 4
with 34
what 14
she 199
meant 3
to 805
be 1200
impartiality 2
deliberated 1
on 86
the 193
probability 2
of 109
each 1
statement 5
but 82
with 34
little 6
success 13
on 86
both 8
sides 23
it 67
was 93
only 1
assertion 3
again 2
she 199
read 49
on 86
but 82
every 10
line 36
proved 1
more 11
clearly 1
that 11
the 193
affair 3
which 2
she 199
had 11
believed 1
it 67
impossible 2
that 11
any 17
contrivance 3
could 2
so 797
represent 11
as 509
to 805
render 7
mr 5
darcy's 1
conduct 21
in 2719
it 67
less 19
than 22
infamous 2
was 93
capable 1
of 109
a 6799
turn 46
which 2
must 28
make 17
him 9
entirely 1
blameless 4
throughout 1
the 193
whole 26
the 193
extravagance 3
and 51
general 22
profligacy 2
which 2
he 962
scrupled 1
not 85
to 805
lay 42
at 272
mr 5
charge 8
exceedingly 1
shocked 1
her 181
the 193
more 11
so 797
as 509
she 199
could 2
bring 6
no 896
proof 11
of 109
its 2
injustice 3
she 199
had 11
never 3
heard 1
of 109
him 9
before 2
his 43
entrance 6
into 26
the 193
shire 3
militia 6
in 2719
which 2
he 962
had 11
engaged 1
at 272
the 193
persuasion 3
of 109
the 193
young 9
man 342
who 79
on 86
meeting 6
him 9
accidentally 1
in 2719
town 27
had 11
there 21
renewed 1
a 6799
slight 10
acquaintance 5
of 109
his 43
former 3
way 27
of 109
life 44
nothing 5
had 11
been 1
known 1
in 2719
but 82
what 14
he 962
told 1
himself 1
as 509
to 805
his 43
real 47
character 16
had 11
information 3
been 1
in 2719
her 181
power 19
she 199
had 11
never 3
felt 5
a 6799
wish 13
of 109
inquiring 2
his 43
countenance 4
voice 8
and 51
manner 8
had 11
established 1
him 9
at 272
once 2
in 2719
the 193
possession 3
of 109
every 10
virtue 3
she 199
tried 1
to 805
recollect 7
some 30
instance 4
of 109
goodness 2
some 30
distinguished 1
trait 8
of 109
integrity 2
or 333
benevolence 3
that 11
might 9
rescue 7
him 9
from 2
the 193
attacks 1
of 109
mr 5
darcy 2
or 333
at 272
least 3
by 57
the 193
predominance 2
of 109
virtue 3
atone 5
for 484
those 1
casual 9
errors 1
under 288
which 2
she 199
would 5
to 805
class 44
what 14
mr 5
darcy 2
had 11
described 1
as 509
the 193
idleness 2
and 51
vice 14
of 109
many 2
continuance 3
but 82
no 896
such 2
recollection 3
befriended 1
her 181
she 199
could 2
see 70
him 9
instantly 1
before 2
her 181
in 2719
every 10
charm 14
of 109
air 129
and 51
address 9
but 82
she 199
could 2
remember 4
no 896
more 11
substantial 2
good 28
than 22
the 193
general 22
approbation 3
of 109
the 193
and 51
the 193
regard 7
which 2
his 43
social 19
powers 1
had 11
gained 1
him 9
in 2719
the 193
mess 31
after 48
pausing 1
on 86
this 6
point 22
a 6799
considerable 1
while 4
she 199
once 2
more 11
continued 1
to 805
read 49
but 82
alas 6
the 193
story 13
which 2
followed 1
of 109
his 43
designs 1
on 86
miss 71
darcy 2
received 1
some 30
confirmation 3
from 2
what 14
had 11
passed 1
between 1
colonel 5
and 51
herself 1
only 1
the 193
morning 3
before 2
and 51
at 272
last 7
she 199
was 93
referred 1
for 484
the 193
truth 7
of 109
every 10
particular 13
to 805
colonel 5
himself 1
from 2
whom 3
she 199
had 11
previously 1
received 1
the 193
information 3
of 109
his 43
near 15
concern 6
in 2719
all 162
his 43
cousin's 1
affairs 1
and 51
whose 1
character 16
she 199
had 11
no 896
reason 13
to 805
question 16
at 272
one 19
time 45
she 199
had 11
almost 1
resolved 1
on 86
applying 1
to 805
him 9
but 82
the 193
idea 21
was 93
checked 1
by 57
the 193
awkwardness 2
of 109
the 193
application 3
and 51
at 272
length 14
wholly 1
banished 1
by 57
the 193
conviction 3
that 11
mr 5
darcy 2
would 5
never 3
have 11
hazarded 1
such 2
a 6799
proposal 3
if 8
he 962
had 11
not 85
been 1
well 24
assured 4
of 109
his 43
cousin's 1
corroboration 3
she 199
perfectly 1
remembered 1
everything 2
that 11
had 11
passed 1
in 2719
conversation 8
between 1
and 51
herself 1
in 2719
their 2
first 8
evening 3
at 272
mr 5
many 2
of 109
his 43
expressions 1
were 5
still 13
fresh 22
in 2719
her 181
memory 2
she 199
was 93
now 10
struck 1
with 34
the 193
impropriety 2
of 109
such 2
communications 1
to 805
a 6799
stranger 3
and 51
wondered 1
it 67
had 11
escaped 1
her 181
before 2
she 199
saw 24
the 193
indelicacy 2
of 109
putting 1
himself 1
forward 12
as 509
he 962
had 11
done 3
and 51
the 193
inconsistency 2
of 109
his 43
professions 1
with 34
his 43
conduct 21
she 199
remembered 1
that 11
he 962
had 11
boasted 1
of 109
having 1
no 896
fear 14
of 109
seeing 2
mr 5
darcy 2
that 11
mr 5
darcy 2
might 9
leave 14
the 193
country 12
but 82
that 11
he 962
should 7
stand 42
his 43
ground 36
yet 4
he 962
had 11
avoided 1
the 193
ball 77
the 193
very 1
next 2
week 20
she 199
remembered 1
also 3
that 11
till 14
the 193
family 2
had 11
the 193
country 12
he 962
had 11
told 1
his 43
story 13
to 805
no 896
one 19
but 82
herself 1
but 82
that 11
after 48
their 2
removal 3
it 67
had 11
been 1
everywhere 1
discussed 1
that 11
he 962
had 11
then 5
no 896
reserves 1
no 896
scruples 1
in 2719
sinking 1
mr 5
darcy's 1
character 16
though 12
he 962
had 11
assured 4
her 181
that 11
respect 18
for 484
the 193
father 12
would 5
always 1
prevent 13
his 43
exposing 1
the 193
son 70
how 27
differently 1
did 23
everything 2
now 10
appear 7
in 2719
which 2
he 962
was 93
concerned 2
his 43
attentions 1
to 805
miss 71
king 23
were 5
now 10
the 193
consequence 3
of 109
views 1
solely 1
and 51
hatefully 1
mercenary 2
and 51
the 193
mediocrity 2
of 109
her 181
fortune 8
proved 1
no 896
longer 1
the 193
moderation 2
of 109
his 43
wishes 1
but 82
his 43
eagerness 2
to 805
grasp 6
at 272
anything 3
his 43
to 805
herself 1
could 2
now 10
have 11
had 11
no 896
tolerable 1
motive 4
he 962
had 11
either 1
been 1
deceived 1
with 34
regard 7
to 805
her 181
fortune 8
or 333
had 11
been 1
gratifying 2
his 43
vanity 2
by 57
encouraging 2
the 193
preference 3
which 2
she 199
believed 1
she 199
had 11
most 3
incautiously 1
shown 1
every 10
lingering 3
struggle 4
in 2719
his 43
grew 1
fainter 1
and 51
fainter 1
and 51
in 2719
farther 2
justification 3
of 109
mr 5
darcy 2
she 199
could 2
not 85
but 82
allow 9
that 11
mr 5
when 6
questioned 1
by 57
jane 8
had 11
long 49
ago 15
asserted 1
his 43
blamelessness 2
in 2719
the 193
affair 3
that 11
proud 5
and 51
repulsive 4
as 509
were 5
his 43
manners 1
she 199
had 11
never 3
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
course 10
of 109
their 2
acquaintance 5
an 970
acquaintance 5
which 2
had 11
latterly 1
brought 1
them 9
much 2
together 3
and 51
given 3
her 181
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
intimacy 2
with 34
his 43
ways 4
seen 1
anything 3
that 11
betrayed 1
him 9
to 805
be 1200
unprincipled 1
or 333
unjust 5
anything 3
that 11
spoke 14
him 9
of 109
irreligious 1
or 333
immoral 5
habits 1
that 11
among 1
his 43
own 9
connections 1
he 962
was 93
esteemed 1
and 51
valued 1
that 11
even 36
had 11
allowed 1
him 9
merit 13
as 509
a 6799
brother 9
and 51
that 11
she 199
had 11
often 4
heard 1
him 9
speak 12
so 797
affectionately 1
of 109
his 43
sister 9
as 509
to 805
prove 21
him 9
capable 1
of 109
some 30
amiable 1
feeling 4
that 11
had 11
his 43
actions 1
been 1
what 14
mr 5
represented 1
them 9
so 797
gross 10
a 6799
violation 3
of 109
everything 2
right 31
could 2
hardly 1
have 11
been 1
concealed 1
from 2
the 193
world 12
and 51
that 11
friendship 3
between 1
a 6799
person 33
capable 1
of 109
it 67
and 51
such 2
an 970
amiable 1
man 342
as 509
mr 5
was 93
incomprehensible 1
she 199
grew 1
absolutely 1
ashamed 2
of 109
herself 1
of 109
neither 1
darcy 2
nor 102
could 2
she 199
think 8
without 1
feeling 4
she 199
had 11
been 1
blind 22
partial 6
prejudiced 1
absurd 9
how 27
despicably 1
i 4330
have 11
acted 1
she 199
cried 1
i 4330
who 79
have 11
prided 1
myself 1
on 86
my 90
discernment 2
i 4330
who 79
have 11
valued 1
myself 1
on 86
my 90
abilities 1
who 79
have 11
often 4
disdained 1
the 193
generous 4
of 109
my 90
sister 9
and 51
gratified 1
my 90
vanity 2
in 2719
useless 4
or 333
mistrust 7
how 27
humiliating 2
is 124
this 6
discovery 2
yet 4
how 27
just 24
a 6799
humiliation 3
had 11
i 4330
been 1
in 2719
love 29
i 4330
could 2
not 85
have 11
been 1
more 11
wretchedly 1
blind 22
but 82
vanity 2
not 85
love 29
has 41
been 1
my 90
folly 2
pleased 1
with 34
the 193
preference 3
of 109
one 19
and 51
offended 1
by 57
the 193
neglect 9
of 109
the 193
other 5
on 86
the 193
very 1
beginning 3
of 109
our 3
acquaintance 5
i 4330
have 11
courted 1
prepossession 3
and 51
ignorance 2
and 51
driven 1
reason 13
away 1
where 21
either 1
were 5
concerned 2
till 14
this 6
moment 14
i 4330
never 3
knew 1
myself 1
from 2
herself 1
to 805
jane 8
from 2
jane 8
to 805
her 181
thoughts 1
were 5
in 2719
a 6799
line 36
which 2
soon 3
brought 1
to 805
her 181
recollection 3
that 11
mr 5
darcy's 1
explanation 3
there 21
had 11
appeared 1
very 1
insufficient 2
and 51
she 199
read 49
it 67
again 2
widely 1
different 11
was 93
the 193
effect 15
of 109
a 6799
second 16
perusal 3
how 27
could 2
she 199
deny 2
that 11
credit 12
to 805
his 43
assertions 1
in 2719
one 19
instance 4
which 2
she 199
had 11
been 1
obliged 1
to 805
give 15
in 2719
the 193
other 5
he 962
declared 1
himself 1
to 805
be 1200
totally 1
of 109
her 181
sister's 1
attachment 3
and 51
she 199
could 2
not 85
help 23
remembering 1
what 14
charlotte's 1
opinion 4
had 11
always 1
been 1
neither 1
could 2
she 199
deny 2
the 193
justice 3
of 109
his 43
description 3
of 109
jane 8
she 199
felt 5
that 11
feelings 1
though 12
fervent 2
were 5
little 6
displayed 1
and 51
that 11
there 21
was 93
a 6799
constant 7
complacency 2
in 2719
her 181
air 129
and 51
manner 8
not 85
often 4
united 2
with 34
great 12
sensibility 2
when 6
she 199
came 36
to 805
that 11
part 102
of 109
the 193
letter 20
in 2719
which 2
her 181
family 2
were 5
mentioned 1
in 2719
terms 1
of 109
such 2
mortifying 1
yet 4
merited 1
reproach 8
her 181
sense 8
of 109
shame 14
was 93
severe 7
the 193
justice 3
of 109
the 193
charge 8
struck 1
her 181
too 50
forcibly 1
for 484
denial 3
and 51
the 193
circumstances 1
to 805
which 2
he 962
particularly 1
alluded 1
as 509
having 1
passed 1
at 272
the 193
ball 77
and 51
as 509
confirming 1
all 162
his 43
first 8
disapprobation 2
could 2
not 85
have 11
made 13
a 6799
stronger 1
impression 12
on 86
his 43
mind 25
than 22
on 86
hers 9
the 193
compliment 6
to 805
herself 1
and 51
her 181
sister 9
was 93
not 85
it 67
soothed 1
but 82
it 67
could 2
not 85
console 4
her 181
for 484
the 193
contempt 8
which 2
had 11
thus 1
been 1
self 11
attracted 1
by 57
the 193
rest 110
of 109
her 181
family 2
and 51
as 509
she 199
considered 1
that 11
disappointment 3
had 11
in 2719
fact 35
been 1
the 193
work 87
of 109
her 181
nearest 1
relations 4
and 51
reflected 1
how 27
materially 1
the 193
credit 12
of 109
both 8
must 28
be 1200
hurt 12
by 57
such 2
impropriety 2
of 109
conduct 21
she 199
felt 5
depressed 1
beyond 1
anything 3
she 199
had 11
ever 33
known 1
before 2
after 48
wandering 3
along 3
the 193
lane 3
for 484
two 14
hours 1
giving 2
way 27
to 805
every 10
variety 2
of 109
thought 11
re 3833
considering 1
events 1
determining 1
probabilities 1
and 51
reconciling 1
herself 1
as 509
well 24
as 509
she 199
could 2
to 805
a 6799
change 21
so 797
sudden 4
and 51
so 797
important 2
fatigue 5
and 51
a 6799
recollection 3
of 109
her 181
long 49
absence 3
made 13
her 181
at 272
length 14
return 14
home 90
and 51
she 199
entered 1
the 193
house 87
with 34
the 193
wish 13
of 109
appearing 1
cheerful 6
as 509
usual 3
and 51
the 193
resolution 3
of 109
repressing 1
such 2
reflections 1
as 509
must 28
make 17
her 181
unfit 6
for 484
conversation 8
she 199
was 93
immediately 1
told 1
that 11
the 193
two 14
gentlemen 1
from 2
had 11
each 1
called 1
during 1
her 181
absence 3
mr 5
darcy 2
only 1
for 484
a 6799
few 6
minutes 2
to 805
take 18
leave 14
but 82
that 11
colonel 5
had 11
been 1
sitting 3
with 34
them 9
at 272
least 3
an 970
hour 10
hoping 1
for 484
her 181
return 14
and 51
almost 1
resolving 1
to 805
walk 25
after 48
her 181
till 14
she 199
could 2
be 1200
found 18
elizabeth 5
could 2
but 82
just 24
affect 15
concern 6
in 2719
missing 1
him 9
she 199
really 1
rejoiced 1
at 272
it 67
colonel 5
was 93
no 896
longer 1
an 970
object 26
she 199
could 2
think 8
only 1
of 109
her 181
letter 20
chapter 3
the 193
two 14
gentlemen 1
left 19
the 193
next 2
morning 3
and 51
mr 5
collins 1
having 1
been 1
in 2719
waiting 2
near 15
the 193
lodges 1
to 805
make 17
them 9
his 43
parting 3
obeisance 3
was 93
able 3
to 805
bring 6
home 90
the 193
pleasing 3
intelligence 2
of 109
their 2
appearing 1
in 2719
very 1
good 28
health 12
and 51
in 2719
as 509
tolerable 1
spirits 1
as 509
could 2
be 1200
expected 1
after 48
the 193
melancholy 2
scene 5
so 797
lately 1
gone 4
through 4
at 272
to 805
he 962
then 5
hastened 1
to 805
console 4
lady 18
catherine 2
and 51
her 181
daughter 4
and 51
on 86
his 43
return 14
brought 1
back 182
with 34
great 12
satisfaction 3
a 6799
message 4
from 2
her 181
ladyship 3
importing 1
that 11
she 199
felt 5
herself 1
so 797
dull 13
as 509
to 805
make 17
her 181
very 1
desirous 1
of 109
having 1
them 9
all 162
to 805
dine 9
with 34
her 181
elizabeth 5
could 2
not 85
see 70
lady 18
catherine 2
without 1
recollecting 1
that 11
had 11
she 199
chosen 1
it 67
she 199
might 9
by 57
this 6
time 45
have 11
been 1
presented 1
to 805
her 181
as 509
her 181
future 3
niece 3
nor 102
could 2
she 199
think 8
without 1
a 6799
smile 7
of 109
what 14
her 181
ladyship's 1
indignation 2
would 5
have 11
been 1
what 14
would 5
she 199
have 11
said 1
how 27
would 5
she 199
have 11
behaved 1
were 5
questions 1
with 34
which 2
she 199
amused 1
herself 1
their 2
first 8
subject 11
was 93
the 193
diminution 3
of 109
the 193
party 3
i 4330
assure 6
you 29
i 4330
feel 11
it 67
exceedingly 1
said 1
lady 18
catherine 2
i 4330
believe 6
no 896
one 19
feels 1
the 193
loss 3
of 109
friends 4
so 797
much 2
as 509
i 4330
do 814
but 82
i 4330
am 392
particularly 1
attached 1
to 805
these 4
young 9
men 140
and 51
know 12
them 9
to 805
be 1200
so 797
much 2
attached 1
to 805
me 1041
they 5
were 5
excessively 1
sorry 1
to 805
go 500
but 82
so 797
they 5
always 1
are 12
the 193
dear 15
colonel 5
rallied 1
his 43
spirits 1
tolerably 1
till 14
just 24
at 272
last 7
but 82
darcy 2
seemed 1
to 805
feel 11
it 67
most 3
acutely 1
more 11
i 4330
think 8
than 22
last 7
year 19
his 43
attachment 3
to 805
certainly 1
increases 1
mr 5
collins 1
had 11
a 6799
compliment 6
and 51
an 970
allusion 3
to 805
throw 14
in 2719
here 31
which 2
were 5
kindly 1
smiled 1
on 86
by 57
the 193
mother 21
and 51
daughter 4
lady 18
catherine 2
observed 1
after 48
dinner 9
that 11
miss 71
bennet 1
seemed 1
out 365
of 109
spirits 1
and 51
immediately 1
accounting 2
for 484
it 67
by 57
herself 1
by 57
supposing 1
that 11
she 199
did 23
not 85
like 22
to 805
go 500
home 90
again 2
so 797
soon 3
she 199
added 1
but 82
if 8
that 11
is 124
the 193
case 25
you 29
must 28
write 5
to 805
your 4
mother 21
and 51
beg 59
that 11
you 29
may 49
stay 7
a 6799
little 6
longer 1
mrs 1
collins 1

be 1200
very 1
glad 30
of 109
your 4
company 2
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
i 4330
am 392
much 2
obliged 1
to 805
your 4
ladyship 3
for 484
your 4
kind 31
invitation 6
replied 1
elizabeth 5
but 82
it 67
is 124
not 85
in 2719
my 90
power 19
to 805
accept 16
it 67
i 4330
must 28
be 1200
in 2719
town 27

saturday 3
why 4
at 272
that 11
rate 9
you 29
will 39
have 11
been 1
here 31
only 1
six 24
weeks 2
i 4330
expected 1

to 805
stay 7
two 14
months 1
i 4330
told 1
mrs 1
collins 1
so 797
before 2
you 29
came 36
there 21
can 287
be 1200
no 896
occasion 7
for 484
your 4
going 3
so 797
soon 3
mrs 1
bennet 1
could 2
certainly 1
spare 11
you 29
for 484
another 1
fortnight 4
but 82
my 90
father 12
cannot 1
he 962
wrote 1
last 7
week 20
to 805

your 4
father 12
of 109
course 10

spare 11
you 29
if 8
your 4
mother 21
can 287
daughters 1
are 12
never 3
of 109
so 797
much 2
consequence 3
to 805
a 6799
father 12
and 51
if 8
you 29
will 39
stay 7
another 1
month 6
complete 8
it 67
will 39
be 1200
in 2719
my 90
power 19
to 805

one 19
of 109
you 29
as 509
far 91
as 509

i 4330
am 392
going 3
there 21
early 1
in 2719
june 5
for 484
a 6799
week 20
and 51
as 509
dawson 1
does 5
not 85
object 26
to 805
the 193
box 21
there 21
will 39
be 1200
very 1
good 28
room 22
for 484
one 19
of 109
you 29
and 51
indeed 1
if 8
the 193
weather 33
should 7
happen 9
to 805
be 1200
cool 22
i 4330
should 7
not 85
object 26
to 805
taking 4
you 29
both 8
as 509
you 29
are 12
neither 1
of 109
you 29
large 11
you 29
are 12
all 162
kindness 3
madam 5
but 82
i 4330
believe 6
we 444
must 28
abide 2
by 57
our 3
original 6
plan 61
lady 18
catherine 2
seemed 1
resigned 2
mrs 1
collins 1
you 29
must 28
send 10
a 6799
servant 3
with 34
them 9
you 29
know 12
i 4330
always 1
speak 12
my 90
mind 25
and 51
i 4330
cannot 1
bear 30
the 193
idea 21
of 109
two 14
young 9
women 5
post 113
by 57
themselves 1
it 67
is 124
highly 1
improper 2
you 29
must 28
contrive 6
to 805
send 10
somebody 2
i 4330
have 11
the 193
greatest 1
dislike 4
in 2719
the 193
world 12
to 805
that 11
sort 14
of 109
thing 15
young 9
women 5
should 7
always 1
be 1200
properly 1
guarded 2
and 51
attended 1
according 2
to 805
their 2
situation 3
in 2719
life 44
when 6
my 90
niece 3
went 1
to 805
last 7
summer 13
i 4330
made 13
a 6799
point 22
of 109
her 181
having 1
two 14
men 140
servants 1
go 500
with 34
her 181
miss 71
darcy 2
the 193
daughter 4
of 109
mr 5
darcy 2
of 109
and 51
lady 18
anne 18
could 2
not 85
have 11
appeared 1
with 34
propriety 2
in 2719
a 6799
different 11
manner 8
i 4330
am 392
excessively 1
attentive 4
to 805
all 162
those 1
things 1
you 29
must 28
send 10
john 20
with 34
the 193
young 9
ladies 1
mrs 1
collins 1
i 4330
am 392
glad 30
it 67
occurred 1
to 805
me 1041
to 805
mention 5
it 67
for 484
it 67
would 5
really 1
be 1200
discreditable 1
to 805
you 29
to 805
let 50
them 9
go 500
alone 1
my 90
uncle 18
is 124
to 805
send 10
a 6799
servant 3
for 484
us 70
oh 17
your 4
uncle 18
he 962
keeps 4
a 6799
man 342
servant 3
does 5
he 962
i 4330
am 392
very 1
glad 30
you 29
have 11
somebody 2
who 79
thinks 1
of 109
these 4
things 1
where 21
shall 12
you 29
change 21
horses 7
oh 17
of 109
course 10
if 8
you 29
mention 5
my 90
name 17
at 272
the 193
bell 66
you 29
will 39
be 1200
attended 1
to 805
lady 18
catherine 2
had 11
many 2
other 5
questions 1
to 805
ask 6
respecting 1
their 2
journey 11
and 51
as 509
she 199
did 23
not 85
answer 8
them 9
all 162
herself 1
attention 3
was 93
necessary 2
which 2
elizabeth 5
believed 1
to 805
be 1200
lucky 1
for 484
her 181
or 333
with 34
a 6799
mind 25
so 797
occupied 1
she 199
might 9
have 11
forgotten 1
where 21
she 199
was 93
reflection 3
must 28
be 1200
reserved 4
for 484
solitary 2
hours 1
whenever 1
she 199
was 93
alone 1
she 199
gave 4
way 27
to 805
it 67
as 509
the 193
greatest 1
relief 3
and 51
not 85
a 6799
day 27
went 1
by 57
without 1
a 6799
solitary 2
walk 25
in 2719
which 2
she 199
might 9
indulge 8
in 2719
all 162
the 193
delight 8
of 109
unpleasant 4
recollections 1
mr 5
darcy's 1
letter 20
she 199
was 93
in 2719
a 6799
fair 25
way 27
of 109
soon 3
knowing 3
by 57
heart 57
she 199
studied 2
every 10
sentence 4
and 51
her 181
feelings 1
towards 1
its 2
writer 3
were 5
at 272
times 10
widely 1
different 11
when 6
she 199
remembered 1
the 193
style 4
of 109
his 43
address 9
she 199
was 93
still 13
full 16
of 109
indignation 2
but 82
when 6
she 199
considered 1
how 27
unjustly 1
she 199
had 11
condemned 1
and 51
upbraided 1
him 9
her 181
anger 5
was 93
turned 1
against 1
herself 1
and 51
his 43
disappointed 1
feelings 1
became 1
the 193
object 26
of 109
compassion 4
his 43
attachment 3
excited 2
gratitude 2
his 43
general 22
character 16
respect 18
but 82
she 199
could 2
not 85
approve 3
him 9
nor 102
could 2
she 199
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
repent 8
her 181
refusal 3
or 333
feel 11
the 193
slightest 1
inclination 3
ever 33
to 805
see 70
him 9
again 2
in 2719
her 181
own 9
past 71
there 21
was 93
a 6799
constant 7
source 4
of 109
vexation 3
and 51
regret 9
and 51
in 2719
the 193
unhappy 1
defects 1
of 109
her 181
family 2
a 6799
subject 11
of 109
yet 4
heavier 1
chagrin 5
they 5
were 5
hopeless 4
of 109
remedy 3
her 181
father 12
contented 4
with 34
laughing 6
at 272
them 9
would 5
never 3
exert 7
himself 1
to 805
restrain 10
the 193
wild 36
giddiness 2
of 109
his 43
youngest 1
daughters 1
and 51
her 181
mother 21
with 34
manners 1
so 797
far 91
from 2
right 31
herself 1
was 93
entirely 1
insensible 1
of 109
the 193
evil 15
elizabeth 5
had 11
frequently 1
united 2
with 34
jane 8
in 2719
an 970
to 805
check 40
the 193
imprudence 2
of 109
catherine 2
and 51
lydia 4
but 82
while 4
they 5
were 5
supported 1
by 57
their 2
mother's 1
indulgence 3
what 14
chance 20
could 2
there 21
be 1200
of 109
improvement 3
catherine 2
weak 20
spirited 2
irritable 1
and 51
completely 1
under 288
guidance 2
had 11
been 1
always 1
affronted 1
by 57
their 2
advice 2
and 51
lydia 4
self 11
willed 1
and 51
careless 4
would 5
scarcely 1
give 15
them 9
a 6799
hearing 3
they 5
were 5
ignorant 2
idle 10
and 51
vain 8
while 4
there 21
was 93
an 970
officer 3
in 2719
they 5
would 5
flirt 13
with 34
him 9
and 51
while 4
was 93
within 3
a 6799
walk 25
of 109
they 5
would 5
be 1200
going 3
there 21
forever 3
anxiety 2
on 86
behalf 2
was 93
another 1
prevailing 1
concern 6
and 51
mr 5
darcy's 1
explanation 3
by 57
restoring 1
to 805
all 162
her 181
former 3
good 28
opinion 4
heightened 1
the 193
sense 8
of 109
what 14
jane 8
had 11
lost 1
his 43
affection 5
was 93
proved 1
to 805
have 11
been 1
sincere 4
and 51
his 43
conduct 21
cleared 1
of 109
all 162
blame 12
unless 1
any 17
could 2
attach 10
to 805
the 193
implicitness 2
of 109
his 43
confidence 3
in 2719
his 43
friend 14
how 27
grievous 4
then 5
was 93
the 193
thought 11
that 11
of 109
a 6799
situation 3
so 797
desirable 3
in 2719
every 10
respect 18
so 797
replete 5
with 34
advantage 6
so 797
promising 2
for 484
happiness 2
jane 8
had 11
been 1
deprived 1
by 57
the 193
folly 2
and 51
of 109
her 181
own 9
family 2
when 6
to 805
these 4
recollections 1
was 93
added 1
the 193
development 5
of 109
character 16
it 67
may 49
be 1200
easily 1
believed 1
that 11
the 193
happy 1
spirits 1
which 2
had 11
seldom 1
been 1
depressed 1
before 2
were 5
now 10
so 797
much 2
affected 2
as 509
to 805
make 17
it 67
almost 1
impossible 2
for 484
her 181
to 805
appear 7
tolerably 1
cheerful 6
their 2
engagements 1
at 272
were 5
as 509
frequent 9
during 1
the 193
last 7
week 20
of 109

inquired 1
minutely 1
into 26
the 193
particulars 1
of 109
their 2
journey 11
gave 4
them 9
directions 1
as 509
to 805
the 193
best 37
method 18
of 109
packing 5
and 51
was 93
so 797
urgent 2
on 86
the 193
necessity 2
of 109
placing 2
gowns 1
in 2719
the 193
only 1
right 31
way 27
that 11

invited 1
them 9
to 805

to 805
again 2
next 2
year 19
and 51
miss 71

as 509

elizabeth 5
and 51
mr 5
collins 1
met 180
for 484
breakfast 5
a 6799
few 6
minutes 2
before 2
the 193
others 1
appeared 1
and 51
he 962
took 1
the 193
opportunity 2
of 109
paying 1
the 193
parting 3
civilities 1
which 2
he 962
deemed 1
indispensably 1
necessary 2
i 4330
know 12
not 85
miss 71
elizabeth 5
said 1
he 962
whether 1
mrs 1
collins 1
has 41
yet 4
expressed 1
her 181
sense 8
of 109
your 4
kindness 3
in 2719
coming 3
to 805
us 70
but 82
i 4330
am 392
very 1
certain 5
you 29
will 39
not 85
leave 14
the 193
house 87
without 1
receiving 1
her 181
thanks 4
for 484
it 67
the 193
of 109
your 4
company 2
has 41
been 1
much 2
felt 5
i 4330
assure 6
you 29
we 444
know 12
how 27
little 6
there 21
is 124
to 805
tempt 14
anyone 2
to 805
our 3
humble 9
abode 3
our 3
plain 27
manner 8
of 109
living 5
our 3
small 14
rooms 1
and 51
few 6
domestics 1
and 51
the 193
little 6
we 444
see 70
of 109
the 193
world 12
must 28
make 17
extremely 1
dull 13
to 805
a 6799
young 9
lady 18
like 22
yourself 1
but 82
i 4330
hope 16
you 29
will 39
believe 6
us 70
grateful 4
for 484
the 193
condescension 2
and 51
that 11
we 444
have 11
done 3
everything 2
in 2719
our 3
power 19
to 805
prevent 13
your 4
spending 2
your 4
time 45
unpleasantly 1
elizabeth 5
was 93
eager 6
with 34
her 181
thanks 4
and 51
assurances 1
of 109
happiness 2
she 199
had 11
spent 1
six 24
weeks 2
with 34
great 12
enjoyment 3
and 51
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
being 3
with 34
charlotte 4
and 51
the 193
kind 31
attentions 1
she 199
had 11
received 1
must 28
make 17
her 181
feel 11
the 193
obliged 1
mr 5
collins 1
was 93
gratified 1
and 51
with 34
a 6799
more 11
smiling 2
solemnity 2
replied 1
it 67
gives 1
me 1041
great 12
pleasure 5
to 805
hear 76
that 11
you 29
have 11
passed 1
your 4
time 45
not 85
disagreeably 1
we 444
have 11
certainly 1
done 3
our 3
best 37
and 51
most 3
fortunately 1
having 1
it 67
in 2719
our 3
power 19
to 805
introduce 3
you 29
to 805
very 1
superior 5
society 2
and 51
from 2
our 3
connection 3
with 34
the 193
frequent 9
means 1
of 109
varying 1
the 193
humble 9
home 90
scene 5
i 4330
think 8
we 444
may 49
flatter 10
ourselves 1
that 11
your 4
visit 14
cannot 1
have 11
been 1
entirely 1
irksome 4
our 3
situation 3
with 34
regard 7
to 805
lady 18
catherine's 1
family 2
is 124
indeed 1
the 193
sort 14
of 109
extraordinary 1
advantage 6
and 51
blessing 3
which 2
few 6
can 287
boast 12
you 29
see 70
on 86
what 14
a 6799
footing 3
we 444
are 12
you 29
see 70
how 27
continually 1
we 444
are 12
engaged 1
there 21
in 2719
truth 7
i 4330
must 28
acknowledge 3
that 11
with 34
all 162
the 193
disadvantages 1
of 109
this 6
humble 9
parsonage 3
i 4330
should 7
not 85
think 8
anyone 2
abiding 2
in 2719
it 67
an 970
object 26
of 109
compassion 4
while 4
they 5
are 12
sharers 1
of 109
our 3
intimacy 2
at 272
words 5
were 5
insufficient 2
for 484
the 193
elevation 3
of 109
his 43
feelings 1
and 51
he 962
was 93
obliged 1
to 805
walk 25
about 1
the 193
room 22
while 4
elizabeth 5
tried 1
to 805
unite 4
civility 2
and 51
truth 7
in 2719
a 6799
few 6
short 62
sentences 1
you 29
may 49
in 2719
fact 35
carry 12
a 6799
very 1
report 12
of 109
us 70
into 26
my 90
dear 15
cousin 3
i 4330
flatter 10
myself 1
at 272
least 3
that 11
you 29
will 39
be 1200
able 3
to 805
do 814
so 797
lady 18
catherine's 1
great 12
attentions 1
to 805
mrs 1
collins 1
you 29
have 11
been 1
a 6799
daily 2
witness 5
of 109
and 51
altogether 1
i 4330
trust 26
it 67
does 5
not 85
appear 7
that 11
your 4
friend 14
has 41
drawn 1
an 970
unfortunate 4
but 82
on 86
this 6
point 22
it 67
will 39
be 1200
as 509
well 24
to 805
be 1200
silent 6
only 1
let 50
me 1041
assure 6
you 29
my 90
dear 15
miss 71
elizabeth 5
that 11
i 4330
can 287
from 2
my 90
heart 57
most 3
cordially 1
wish 13
you 29
equal 17
felicity 2
in 2719
marriage 6
my 90
dear 15
charlotte 4
and 51
i 4330
have 11
but 82
one 19
mind 25
and 51
one 19
way 27
of 109
thinking 2
there 21
is 124
in 2719
everything 2
a 6799
most 3
remarkable 3
resemblance 3
of 109
character 16
and 51
ideas 1
between 1
us 70
we 444
seem 10
to 805
have 11
been 1
designed 1
for 484
each 1
other 5
elizabeth 5
could 2
safely 1
say 7
that 11
it 67
was 93
a 6799
great 12
happiness 2
where 21
that 11
was 93
the 193
case 25
and 51
with 34
equal 17
sincerity 2
could 2
add 54
that 11
she 199
firmly 1
believed 1
and 51
rejoiced 1
in 2719
his 43
domestic 12
comforts 1
she 199
was 93
not 85
sorry 1
however 1
to 805
have 11
the 193
recital 6
of 109
them 9
interrupted 1
by 57
the 193
lady 18
from 2
whom 3
they 5
sprang 1
poor 11
charlotte 4
it 67
was 93
melancholy 2
to 805
leave 14
her 181
to 805
such 2
society 2
but 82
she 199
had 11
chosen 1
it 67
with 34
her 181
eyes 8
open 21
and 51
though 12
evidently 1
regretting 1
that 11
her 181
visitors 1
were 5
to 805
go 500
she 199
did 23
not 85
seem 10
to 805
ask 6
for 484
compassion 4
her 181
home 90
and 51
her 181
housekeeping 2
her 181
parish 6
and 51
her 181
poultry 2
and 51
all 162
their 2
dependent 4
concerns 1
had 11
not 85
yet 4
lost 1
their 2
charms 1
at 272
length 14
the 193
chaise 3
arrived 1
the 193
trunks 1
were 5
fastened 1
on 86
the 193
parcels 1
placed 1
within 3
and 51
it 67
was 93
pronounced 1
to 805
be 1200
ready 2
after 48
an 970
affectionate 2
parting 3
between 1
the 193
friends 4
elizabeth 5
was 93
attended 1
to 805
the 193
carriage 5
by 57
mr 5
collins 1
and 51
as 509
they 5
walked 1
down 90
the 193
garden 12
he 962
was 93
commissioning 1
her 181
with 34
his 43
best 37
respects 1
to 805
all 162
her 181
family 2
not 85
forgetting 1
his 43
thanks 4
for 484
the 193
kindness 3
he 962
had 11
received 1
at 272
in 2719
the 193
winter 13
and 51
his 43
compliments 1
to 805
mr 5
and 51
mrs 1
though 12
unknown 3
he 962
then 5
handed 2
her 181
in 2719
maria 12
followed 1
and 51
the 193
door 41
was 93
on 86
the 193
point 22
of 109
being 3
closed 1
when 6
he 962
suddenly 1
reminded 1
them 9
with 34
some 30
consternation 2
that 11
they 5
had 11
hitherto 1
forgotten 1
to 805
leave 14
any 17
message 4
for 484
the 193
ladies 1
at 272
but 82
he 962
added 1
you 29
will 39
of 109
course 10
wish 13
to 805
have 11
your 4
humble 9
respects 1
delivered 1
to 805
them 9
with 34
your 4
grateful 4
thanks 4
for 484
their 2
kindness 3
to 805
you 29
while 4
you 29
have 11
been 1
here 31
elizabeth 5
made 13
no 896
objection 5
the 193
door 41
was 93
then 5
allowed 1
to 805
be 1200
shut 32
and 51
the 193
carriage 5
drove 6
off 100
good 28
gracious 4
cried 1
maria 12
after 48
a 6799
few 6
silence 7
it 67
seems 1
but 82
a 6799
day 27
or 333
two 14
since 7
we 444
first 8
came 36
and 51
yet 4
how 27
many 2
things 1
have 11
happened 1
a 6799
great 12
many 2
indeed 1
said 1
her 181
companion 10
with 34
a 6799
sigh 22
we 444
have 11
dined 1
nine 21
times 10
at 272
besides 1
drinking 2
tea 99
there 21
twice 1
how 27
much 2
i 4330
shall 12
have 11
to 805
tell 16
elizabeth 5
added 1
privately 1
and 51
how 27
much 2
i 4330
shall 12
have 11
to 805
conceal 10
their 2
journey 11
was 93
performed 1
without 1
much 2
conversation 8
or 333
any 17
alarm 9
and 51
within 3
four 26
hours 1
of 109
their 2
leaving 3
they 5
reached 1
mr 5
house 87
where 21
they 5
were 5
to 805
remain 9
a 6799
few 6
days 1
jane 8
looked 1
well 24
and 51
elizabeth 5
had 11
little 6
opportunity 2
of 109
studying 1
her 181
spirits 1
the 193
various 2
engagements 1
which 2
the 193
kindness 3
of 109
her 181
aunt 6
had 11
reserved 4
for 484
them 9
but 82
jane 8
was 93
to 805
go 500
home 90
with 34
her 181
and 51
at 272
there 21
would 5
be 1200
leisure 8
enough 2
for 484
observation 4
it 67
was 93
not 85
without 1
an 970
effort 7
meanwhile 2
that 11
she 199
could 2
wait 19
even 36
for 484
before 2
she 199
told 1
her 181
sister 9
of 109
mr 5
darcy's 1
proposals 1
to 805
know 12
that 11
she 199
had 11
the 193
power 19
of 109
revealing 3
what 14
would 5
so 797
exceedingly 1
astonish 7
jane 8
and 51
must 28
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
so 797
highly 1
gratify 3
whatever 1
of 109
her 181
own 9
vanity 2
she 199
had 11
not 85
yet 4
been 1
able 3
to 805
reason 13
away 1
was 93
such 2
a 6799
temptation 3
to 805
openness 2
as 509
nothing 5
could 2
have 11
conquered 1
but 82
the 193
state 41
of 109
indecision 2
in 2719
which 2
she 199
remained 1
as 509
to 805
the 193
extent 3
of 109
what 14
she 199
should 7
communicate 3
and 51
her 181
fear 14
if 8
she 199
once 2
entered 1
on 86
the 193
subject 11
of 109
being 3
hurried 2
into 26
repeating 2
something 3
of 109
which 2
might 9
only 1
grieve 6
her 181
sister 9
further 8
chapter 3
it 67
was 93
the 193
second 16
week 20
in 2719
may 49
in 2719
which 2
the 193
three 12
young 9
ladies 1
set 40
out 365
together 3
from 2
street 15
for 484
the 193
town 27
of 109
in 2719
and 51
as 509
they 5
drew 2
near 15
the 193
appointed 1
inn 59
where 21
mr 5
carriage 5
was 93
to 805
meet 9
them 9
they 5
quickly 1
perceived 1
in 2719
token 5
of 109
the 193
coachman's 1
punctuality 2
both 8
kitty 2
and 51
lydia 4
looking 1
out 365
of 109
a 6799
dining 1
room 22
up 194
stairs 1
these 4
two 14
girls 1
had 11
been 1
above 3
an 970
hour 10
in 2719
the 193
place 29
happily 1
employed 1
in 2719
visiting 1
an 970
opposite 4
milliner 5
watching 1
the 193
sentinel 3
on 86
guard 26
and 51
dressing 3
a 6799
salad 5
and 51
cucumber 3
after 48
welcoming 1
their 2
sisters 1
they 5
triumphantly 1
displayed 1
a 6799
table 27
set 40
out 365
with 34
such 2
cold 9
meat 17
as 509
an 970
inn 59
larder 3
usually 1
affords 1
exclaiming 1
is 124
not 85
this 6
nice 11
is 124
not 85
this 6
an 970
agreeable 3
surprise 4
and 51
we 444
mean 36
to 805
treat 15
you 29
all 162
added 1
lydia 4
but 82
you 29
must 28
lend 6
us 70
the 193
money 17
for 484
we 444
have 11
just 24
spent 1
ours 2
at 272
the 193
shop 33
out 365
there 21
then 5
showing 3
her 181
purchases 1
look 14
here 31
i 4330
have 11
bought 1
this 6
bonnet 3
i 4330
do 814
not 85
think 8
it 67
is 124
very 1
pretty 3
but 82
i 4330
thought 11
i 4330
might 9
as 509
well 24
buy 13
it 67
as 509
not 85
i 4330
shall 12
pull 26
it 67
to 805
pieces 1
as 509
soon 3
as 509
i 4330
get 13
home 90
and 51
see 70
if 8
i 4330
can 287
make 17
it 67
up 194
any 17
better 7
and 51
when 6
her 181
sisters 1
abused 1
it 67
as 509
ugly 1
she 199
added 1
with 34
perfect 24
unconcern 4
oh 17
but 82
there 21
were 5
two 14
or 333
three 12
much 2
uglier 1
in 2719
the 193
shop 33
and 51
when 6
i 4330
have 11
bought 1
some 30
prettier 1
satin 7
to 805
trim 24
it 67
with 34
fresh 22
i 4330
think 8
it 67
will 39
be 1200
very 1
tolerable 1
besides 1
it 67
will 39

a 6799
nasty 1

of 109
such 2
coarseness 2
of 109

the 193
coarseness 2

in 2719
it 67
lord 13

dear 15
me 1041
we 444
had 11
such 2
a 6799
good 28
piece 10
of 109
fun 88
the 193
other 5
day 27
at 272
colonel 5
kitty 2
and 51
me 1041
were 5
to 805
spend 11
the 193
day 27
there 21
and 51
mrs 1
forster 1
promised 1
to 805
have 11
a 6799
little 6
dance 7
in 2719
the 193
evening 3
by 57
the 193
bye 5
mrs 1
forster 1
and 51
me 1041
are 12
such 2
friends 4
and 51
so 797
she 199
asked 1
the 193
two 14
to 805
come 36
but 82
harriet 4
was 93
ill 84
and 51
so 797
pen 195
was 93
forced 1
to 805
come 36
by 57
herself 1
and 51
then 5
what 14
do 814
you 29
think 8
we 444
did 23
we 444
dressed 1
up 194
in 2719
woman's 1
clothes 10
on 86
purpose 12
to 805
pass 66
for 484
a 6799
lady 18
only 1
think 8
what 14
fun 88
not 85
a 6799
soul 10
knew 1
of 109
it 67
but 82
colonel 5
and 51
mrs 1
forster 1
and 51
kitty 2
and 51
me 1041
except 10
my 90
aunt 6
for 484
we 444
were 5
forced 1
to 805
borrow 9
one 19
of 109
her 181
gowns 1
and 51
you 29
cannot 1
imagine 3
how 27
well 24
he 962
looked 1
when 6
denny 2
and 51
and 51
pratt 10
and 51
two 14
or 333
three 12
more 11
of 109
the 193
men 140
came 36
in 2719
they 5
did 23
not 85
know 12
him 9
in 2719
the 193
least 3
lord 13
how 27
i 4330
laughed 1
and 51
so 797
did 23
mrs 1
forster 1
i 4330
thought 11
i 4330
should 7
have 11
died 1
and 51
that 11
made 13
the 193
men 140
suspect 5
something 3
and 51
then 5
they 5
soon 3
found 18
out 365
what 14
was 93
the 193
matter 7
with 34
such 2
kinds 1
of 109
histories 1
of 109
their 2
parties 1
and 51
good 28
jokes 1
did 23
lydia 4
assisted 1
by 57
kitty's 1
hints 1
and 51
additions 1
to 805
amuse 6
her 181
companions 3
all 162
the 193
way 27
to 805
elizabeth 5
listened 1
as 509
little 6
as 509
she 199
could 2
but 82
there 21
was 93
no 896
escaping 1
the 193
frequent 9
mention 5
of 109
name 17
their 2
reception 6
at 272
home 90
was 93
most 3
kind 31
mrs 1
bennet 1
rejoiced 1
to 805
see 70
jane 8
in 2719
undiminished 1
beauty 2
and 51
more 11
than 22
once 2
during 1
dinner 9
did 23
mr 5
bennet 1
say 7
voluntarily 1
to 805
elizabeth 5
i 4330
am 392
glad 30
you 29
are 12
come 36
back 182
lizzy 2
their 2
party 3
in 2719
the 193
dining 1
room 22
was 93
large 11
for 484
almost 1
all 162
the 193
came 36
to 805
meet 9
maria 12
and 51
hear 76
the 193
news 71
and 51
various 2
were 5
the 193
subjects 1
that 11
occupied 1
them 9
lady 18
lucas 1
was 93
inquiring 2
of 109
maria 12
after 48
the 193
welfare 2
and 51
poultry 2
of 109
her 181
eldest 1
daughter 4
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
doubly 1
engaged 1
on 86
one 19
hand 137
collecting 1
an 970
account 14
of 109
the 193
present 20
fashions 1
from 2
jane 8
who 79
sat 92
some 30
way 27
below 1
her 181
and 51
on 86
the 193
other 5
retailing 1
them 9
all 162
to 805
the 193
younger 1
and 51
lydia 4
in 2719
a 6799
voice 8
rather 2
louder 1
than 22
any 17
other 5
person's 1
was 93
enumerating 1
the 193
various 2
pleasures 1
of 109
the 193
morning 3
to 805
anybody 2
who 79
would 5
hear 76
her 181
oh 17
mary 13
said 1
she 199
i 4330
wish 13
you 29
had 11
gone 4
with 34
us 70
for 484
we 444
had 11
such 2
fun 88
as 509
we 444
went 1
along 3
kitty 2
and 51
i 4330
drew 2
up 194
the 193
blinds 5
and 51
pretended 1
there 21
was 93
nobody 2
in 2719
the 193
coach 11
and 51
i 4330
should 7
have 11
gone 4
so 797
all 162
the 193
way 27
if 8
kitty 2
had 11
not 85
been 1
sick 38
and 51
when 6
we 444
got 14
to 805
the 193
george 6
i 4330
do 814
think 8
we 444
behaved 1
very 1
handsomely 1
for 484
we 444
treated 1
the 193
other 5
three 12
with 34
the 193
nicest 1
cold 9
luncheon 6
in 2719
the 193
world 12
and 51
if 8
you 29
would 5
have 11
gone 4
we 444
would 5
have 11
treated 1
you 29
too 50
and 51
then 5
when 6
we 444
came 36
away 1
it 67
was 93
such 2
fun 88
i 4330
thought 11
we 444
never 3
should 7
have 11
got 14
into 26
the 193
coach 11
i 4330
was 93
ready 2
to 805
die 38
of 109
laughter 2
and 51
then 5
we 444
were 5
so 797
merry 6
all 162
the 193
way 27
home 90
we 444
talked 1
and 51
laughed 1
so 797
loud 16
that 11
anybody 2
might 9
have 11
heard 1
us 70
ten 151
miles 4
off 100
to 805
this 6
mary 13
very 1
gravely 1
replied 1
far 91
be 1200
it 67
from 2
me 1041
my 90
dear 15
sister 9
to 805
depreciate 3
such 2
pleasures 1
they 5
would 5
doubtless 2
be 1200
congenial 4
with 34
the 193
generality 2
of 109
female 5
minds 4
but 82
i 4330
confess 14
they 5
would 5
have 11
no 896
charms 1
for 484
me 1041
i 4330
should 7
infinitely 1
prefer 13
a 6799
book 69
but 82
of 109
this 6
answer 8
lydia 4
heard 1
not 85
a 6799
word 26
she 199
seldom 1
listened 1
to 805
anybody 2
for 484
more 11
than 22
half 23
a 6799
minute 12
and 51
never 3
attended 1
to 805
mary 13
at 272
all 162
in 2719
the 193
afternoon 3
lydia 4
was 93
urgent 2
with 34
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
girls 1
to 805
walk 25
to 805
and 51
to 805
see 70
how 27
everybody 2
went 1
on 86
but 82
elizabeth 5
steadily 1
opposed 1
the 193
scheme 7
it 67
should 7
not 85
be 1200
said 1
that 11
the 193
miss 71
could 2
not 85
be 1200
at 272
home 90
half 23
a 6799
day 27
before 2
they 5
were 5
in 2719
pursuit 3
of 109
the 193
officers 1
there 21
was 93
another 1
reason 13
too 50
for 484
her 181
opposition 3
she 199
dreaded 1
seeing 2
mr 5
again 2
and 51
was 93
resolved 1
to 805
avoid 8
it 67
as 509
long 49
as 509
possible 3
the 193
comfort 14
to 805
her 181
of 109
the 193
regiment's 1
approaching 1
removal 3
was 93
indeed 1
beyond 1
expression 11
in 2719
a 6799
fortnight 4
they 5
were 5
to 805
go 500
and 51
once 2
gone 4
she 199
hoped 1
there 21
could 2
be 1200
nothing 5
more 11
to 805
plague 4
her 181
on 86
his 43
account 14
she 199
had 11
not 85
been 1
many 2
hours 1
at 272
home 90
before 2
she 199
found 18
that 11
the 193
brighton 2
scheme 7
of 109
which 2
lydia 4
had 11
given 3
them 9
a 6799
hint 13
at 272
the 193
inn 59
was 93
under 288
frequent 9
discussion 3
between 1
her 181
parents 1
elizabeth 5
saw 24
directly 1
that 11
her 181
father 12
had 11
not 85
the 193
smallest 1
intention 5
of 109
yielding 2
but 82
his 43
answers 1
were 5
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
so 797
vague 6
and 51
equivocal 4
that 11
her 181
mother 21
though 12
often 4
disheartened 1
had 11
never 3
yet 4
despaired 1
of 109
succeeding 1
at 272
last 7
chapter 3
elizabeth's 1
impatience 3
to 805
acquaint 9
jane 8
with 34
what 14
had 11
happened 1
could 2
no 896
longer 1
be 1200
overcome 2
and 51
at 272
length 14
resolving 1
to 805
suppress 13
every 10
particular 13
in 2719
which 2
her 181
sister 9
was 93
concerned 2
and 51
preparing 1
her 181
to 805
be 1200
surprised 1
she 199
related 3
to 805
her 181
the 193
next 2
morning 3
the 193
chief 14
of 109
the 193
scene 5
between 1
mr 5
darcy 2
and 51
herself 1
miss 71
astonishment 2
was 93
soon 3
lessened 1
by 57
the 193
strong 16
sisterly 1
partiality 2
which 2
made 13
any 17
admiration 2
of 109
elizabeth 5
appear 7
perfectly 1
natural 18
and 51
all 162
surprise 4
was 93
shortly 1
lost 1
in 2719
other 5
feelings 1
she 199
was 93
sorry 1
that 11
mr 5
darcy 2
should 7
have 11
delivered 1
his 43
sentiments 1
in 2719
a 6799
manner 8
so 797
little 6
suited 1
to 805
recommend 8
them 9
but 82
still 13
more 11
was 93
she 199
grieved 1
for 484
the 193
unhappiness 2
which 2
her 181
sister's 1
refusal 3
must 28
have 11
given 3
him 9
his 43
being 3
so 797
sure 11
of 109
succeeding 1
was 93
wrong 24
said 1
she 199
and 51
certainly 1
ought 2
not 85
to 805
have 11
appeared 1
but 82
consider 13
how 27
much 2
it 67
must 28
increase 4
his 43
disappointment 3
indeed 1
replied 1
elizabeth 5
i 4330
am 392
heartily 1
sorry 1
for 484
him 9
but 82
he 962
has 41
other 5
feelings 1
which 2
will 39
probably 1
soon 3
drive 18
away 1
his 43
regard 7
for 484
me 1041
you 29
do 814
not 85
blame 12
me 1041
however 1
for 484
refusing 1
him 9
blame 12
you 29
oh 17
no 896
but 82
you 29
blame 12
me 1041
for 484
having 1
spoken 1
so 797
warmly 1
of 109
no 896
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
that 11
you 29
were 5
wrong 24
in 2719
saying 3
what 14
you 29
did 23
but 82
you 29
will 39
know 12
it 67
when 6
i 4330
tell 16
you 29
what 14
happened 1
the 193
very 1
next 2
day 27
she 199
then 5
spoke 14
of 109
the 193
letter 20
repeating 2
the 193
whole 26
of 109
its 2
contents 1
as 509
far 91
as 509
they 5
concerned 2
george 6
what 14
a 6799
stroke 4
was 93
this 6
for 484
poor 11
jane 8
who 79
would 5
willingly 1
have 11
gone 4
through 4
the 193
world 12
without 1
believing 1
that 11
so 797
much 2
wickedness 2
existed 1
in 2719
the 193
whole 26
race 24
of 109
mankind 2
as 509
was 93
here 31
collected 2
in 2719
one 19
individual 19
nor 102
was 93
darcy's 1
vindication 3
though 12
grateful 4
to 805
her 181
feelings 1
capable 1
of 109
consoling 2
her 181
for 484
such 2
discovery 2
most 3
earnestly 1
did 23
she 199
to 805
prove 21
the 193
probability 2
of 109
error 3
and 51
seek 6
to 805
clear 23
the 193
one 19
without 1
involving 1
the 193
other 5
this 6
will 39
not 85
do 814
said 1
elizabeth 5
you 29
never 3
will 39
be 1200
able 3
to 805
make 17
both 8
of 109
them 9
good 28
for 484
anything 3
take 18
your 4
choice 5
but 82
you 29
must 28
be 1200
satisfied 1
with 34
only 1
one 19
there 21
is 124
but 82
such 2
a 6799
quantity 2
of 109
merit 13
between 1
them 9
just 24
enough 2
to 805
make 17
one 19
good 28
sort 14
of 109
man 342
and 51
of 109
late 23
it 67
has 41
been 1
shifting 1
about 1
pretty 3
much 2
for 484
my 90
part 102
i 4330
am 392
inclined 1
to 805
believe 6
it 67
all 162
darcy's 1
but 82
you 29
shall 12
do 814
as 509
you 29
choose 5
it 67
was 93
some 30
time 45
however 1
before 2
a 6799
smile 7
could 2
be 1200
extorted 1
from 2
jane 8
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
when 6
i 4330
have 11
been 1
more 11
shocked 1
said 1
she 199
so 797
very 1
bad 33
it 67
is 124
almost 1
past 71
belief 3
and 51
poor 11
mr 5
darcy 2
dear 15
lizzy 2
only 1
consider 13
what 14
he 962
must 28
have 11
suffered 1
such 2
a 6799
disappointment 3
and 51
with 34
the 193
knowledge 4
of 109
your 4
ill 84
opinion 4
too 50
and 51
having 1
to 805
relate 8
such 2
a 6799
thing 15
of 109
his 43
sister 9
it 67
is 124
really 1
too 50
distressing 2
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
must 28
feel 11
it 67
so 797
oh 17
no 896
my 90
regret 9
and 51
compassion 4
are 12
all 162
done 3
away 1
by 57
seeing 2
you 29
so 797
full 16
of 109
both 8
i 4330
know 12
you 29
will 39
do 814
him 9
such 2
ample 3
justice 3
that 11
i 4330
am 392
growing 1
every 10
moment 14
more 11
unconcerned 2
and 51
indifferent 2
your 4
profusion 3
makes 4
me 1041
saving 4
and 51
if 8
you 29
lament 10
over 596
him 9
much 2
longer 1
my 90
heart 57
will 39
be 1200
as 509
light 42
as 509
a 6799
feather 15
poor 11
there 21
is 124
such 2
an 970
expression 11
of 109
goodness 2
in 2719
his 43
countenance 4
such 2
an 970
openness 2
and 51
gentleness 2
in 2719
his 43
manner 8
there 21
certainly 1
was 93
some 30
great 12
mismanagement 2
in 2719
the 193
education 9
of 109
those 1
two 14
young 9
men 140
one 19
has 41
got 14
all 162
the 193
goodness 2
and 51
the 193
other 5
all 162
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
it 67
i 4330
never 3
thought 11
mr 5
darcy 2
so 797
deficient 1
in 2719
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
it 67
as 509
you 29
used 1
to 805
do 814
and 51
yet 4
i 4330
meant 3
to 805
be 1200
uncommonly 1
clever 6
in 2719
taking 4
so 797
decided 2
a 6799
dislike 4
to 805
him 9
without 1
any 17
reason 13
it 67
is 124
such 2
a 6799
spur 20
to 805
one's 1
genius 3
such 2
an 970
opening 3
for 484
wit 77
to 805
have 11
a 6799
dislike 4
of 109
that 11
kind 31
one 19
may 49
be 1200
continually 1
abusive 4
without 1
saying 3
anything 3
just 24
but 82
one 19
cannot 1
always 1
be 1200
laughing 6
at 272
a 6799
man 342
without 1
now 10
and 51
then 5
stumbling 1
on 86
something 3
witty 1
lizzy 2
when 6
you 29
first 8
read 49
that 11
letter 20
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
could 2
not 85
treat 15
the 193
matter 7
as 509
you 29
do 814
now 10
indeed 1
i 4330
could 2
not 85
i 4330
was 93
uncomfortable 1
enough 2
i 4330
may 49
say 7
unhappy 1
and 51
with 34
no 896
one 19
to 805
speak 12
to 805
about 1
what 14
i 4330
felt 5
no 896
jane 8
to 805
comfort 14
me 1041
and 51
say 7
that 11
i 4330
had 11
not 85
been 1
so 797
very 1
weak 20
and 51
vain 8
and 51
nonsensical 2
as 509
i 4330
knew 1
i 4330
had 11
oh 17
how 27
i 4330
wanted 1
you 29
how 27
unfortunate 4
that 11
you 29
should 7
have 11
used 1
such 2
very 1
strong 16
expressions 1
in 2719
speaking 2
of 109
to 805
mr 5
darcy 2
for 484
now 10
they 5
do 814
appear 7
wholly 1
undeserved 2
certainly 1
but 82
the 193
misfortune 3
of 109
speaking 2
with 34
bitterness 2
is 124
a 6799
most 3
natural 18
consequence 3
of 109
the 193
prejudices 1
i 4330
had 11
been 1
encouraging 2
there 21
is 124
one 19
point 22
on 86
which 2
i 4330
want 13
your 4
advice 2
i 4330
want 13
to 805
be 1200
told 1
whether 1
i 4330
ought 2
or 333
ought 2
not 85
to 805
make 17
our 3
acquaintances 3
in 2719
general 22
understand 8
character 16
miss 71
bennet 1
paused 1
a 6799
little 6
and 51
then 5
replied 1
surely 1
there 21
can 287
be 1200
no 896
occasion 7
for 484
exposing 1
him 9
so 797
dreadfully 1
what 14
is 124
your 4
opinion 4
that 11
it 67
ought 2
not 85
to 805
be 1200
attempted 1
mr 5
darcy 2
has 41
not 85
me 1041
to 805
make 17
his 43
communication 3
public 18
on 86
the 193
contrary 2
every 10
particular 13
relative 4
to 805
his 43
sister 9
was 93
meant 3
to 805
be 1200
kept 1
as 509
much 2
as 509
possible 3
to 805
myself 1
and 51
if 8
i 4330
to 805
undeceive 3
people 4
as 509
to 805
the 193
rest 110
of 109
his 43
conduct 21
who 79
will 39
believe 6
me 1041
the 193
general 22
prejudice 4
against 1
mr 5
darcy 2
is 124
so 797
violent 2
that 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
the 193
death 19
of 109
half 23
the 193
good 28
people 4
in 2719
to 805
attempt 5
to 805
place 29
him 9
in 2719
an 970
amiable 1
light 42
i 4330
am 392
not 85
equal 17
to 805
it 67
will 39
soon 3
be 1200
gone 4
and 51
therefore 1
it 67
will 39
not 85
signify 2
to 805
anyone 2
here 31
what 14
he 962
really 1
is 124
some 30
time 45
hence 3
it 67
will 39
be 1200
all 162
found 18
out 365
and 51
then 5
we 444
may 49
laugh 14
at 272
their 2
stupidity 2
in 2719
not 85
knowing 3
it 67
before 2
at 272
present 20
i 4330
will 39
say 7
nothing 5
about 1
it 67
you 29
are 12
quite 1
right 31
to 805
have 11
his 43
errors 1
made 13
public 18
might 9
ruin 10
him 9
for 484
ever 33
he 962
is 124
now 10
perhaps 1
sorry 1
for 484
what 14
he 962
has 41
done 3
and 51
anxious 4
to 805
re 3833
establish 7
a 6799
character 16
we 444
must 28
not 85
make 17
him 9
desperate 4
the 193
tumult 5
of 109
elizabeth's 1
mind 25
was 93
allayed 1
by 57
this 6
conversation 8
she 199
had 11
got 14
rid 42
of 109
two 14
of 109
the 193
secrets 1
which 2
had 11
weighed 1
on 86
her 181
for 484
a 6799
fortnight 4
and 51
was 93
certain 5
of 109
a 6799
willing 4
listener 3
in 2719
jane 8
whenever 1
she 199
might 9
wish 13
to 805
talk 18
again 2
of 109
either 1
but 82
there 21
was 93
still 13
something 3
lurking 1
behind 4
of 109
which 2
prudence 2
forbade 1
the 193
disclosure 3
she 199
dared 6
not 85
relate 8
the 193
other 5
half 23
of 109
mr 5
darcy's 1
letter 20
nor 102
explain 5
to 805
her 181
sister 9
how 27
sincerely 1
she 199
had 11
been 1
valued 1
by 57
her 181
friend 14
here 31
was 93
knowledge 4
in 2719
which 2
no 896
one 19
could 2
partake 6
and 51
she 199
was 93
sensible 3
that 11
nothing 5
less 19
than 22
a 6799
perfect 24
understanding 4
between 1
the 193
parties 1
could 2
justify 2
her 181
in 2719
throwing 1
off 100
this 6
last 7
encumbrance 3
of 109
mystery 2
and 51
then 5
said 1
she 199
if 8
that 11
very 1
improbable 1
event 18
should 7
ever 33
take 18
place 29
i 4330
shall 12
merely 1
be 1200
able 3
to 805
tell 16
what 14
may 49
tell 16
in 2719
a 6799
much 2
more 11
agreeable 3
manner 8
himself 1
the 193
liberty 2
of 109
communication 3
cannot 1
be 1200
mine 26
till 14
it 67
has 41
lost 1
all 162
its 2
value 8
she 199
was 93
now 10
on 86
being 3
settled 1
at 272
home 90
at 272
leisure 8
to 805
observe 6
the 193
real 47
state 41
of 109
her 181
sister's 1
spirits 1
jane 8
was 93
not 85
happy 1
she 199
still 13
cherished 1
a 6799
very 1
tender 27
affection 5
for 484
having 1
never 3
even 36
fancied 1
herself 1
in 2719
love 29
before 2
her 181
regard 7
had 11
all 162
the 193
warmth 2
of 109
first 8
attachment 3
and 51
from 2
her 181
age 24
and 51
disposition 3
greater 1
steadiness 2
than 22
most 3
first 8
attachments 1
often 4
boast 12
and 51
so 797
fervently 1
did 23
she 199
value 8
his 43
remembrance 3
and 51
prefer 13
him 9
to 805
every 10
other 5
man 342
that 11
all 162
her 181
good 28
sense 8
and 51
all 162
her 181
attention 3
to 805
the 193
feelings 1
of 109
her 181
friends 4
were 5
requisite 3
to 805
check 40
the 193
indulgence 3
of 109
those 1
regrets 1
which 2
must 28
have 11
been 1
injurious 1
to 805
her 181
own 9
health 12
and 51
their 2
well 24
lizzy 2
said 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
one 19
day 27
what 14
is 124
your 4
opinion 4
now 10
of 109
this 6
sad 47
business 13
of 109
for 484
my 90
part 102
i 4330
am 392
determined 2
never 3
to 805
speak 12
of 109
it 67
again 2
to 805
anybody 2
i 4330
told 1
my 90
sister 9
phillips 1
so 797
the 193
other 5
day 27
but 82
i 4330
cannot 1
find 10
out 365
that 11
jane 8
saw 24
anything 3
of 109
him 9
in 2719
london 5
well 24
he 962
is 124
a 6799
very 1
undeserving 1
young 9
man 342
and 51
i 4330
do 814
not 85
suppose 4
there's 1
the 193
least 3
chance 20
in 2719
the 193
world 12
of 109
her 181
ever 33
getting 1
him 9
now 10
there 21
is 124
no 896
talk 18
of 109
his 43
coming 3
to 805
again 2
in 2719
the 193
summer 13
and 51
i 4330
have 11
inquired 1
of 109
everybody 2
too 50
who 79
is 124
likely 1
to 805
know 12
i 4330
do 814
not 85
believe 6
he 962
will 39
ever 33
live 43
at 272
any 17
more 11
oh 17
well 24
it 67
is 124
just 24
as 509
he 962
chooses 1
nobody 2
wants 1
him 9
to 805
come 36
though 12
i 4330
shall 12
always 1
say 7
he 962
used 1
my 90
daughter 4
extremely 1
ill 84
and 51
if 8
i 4330
was 93
her 181
i 4330
would 5
not 85
have 11
put 47
up 194
with 34
it 67
well 24
my 90
comfort 14
is 124
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
jane 8
will 39
die 38
of 109
a 6799
broken 6
heart 57
and 51
then 5
he 962
will 39
be 1200
sorry 1
for 484
what 14
he 962
has 41
done 3
but 82
as 509
elizabeth 5
could 2
not 85
receive 8
comfort 14
from 2
any 17
such 2
expectation 3
she 199
made 13
no 896
answer 8
well 24
lizzy 2
continued 1
her 181
mother 21
soon 3
afterwards 1
and 51
so 797
the 193
live 43
very 1
comfortable 3
do 814
they 5
well 24
well 24
i 4330
only 1
hope 16
it 67
will 39
last 7
and 51
what 14
sort 14
of 109
table 27
do 814
they 5
keep 11
charlotte 4
is 124
an 970
excellent 2
manager 6
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
if 8
she 199
is 124
half 23
as 509
sharp 30
as 509
her 181
mother 21
she 199
is 124
saving 4
enough 2
there 21
is 124
nothing 5
extravagant 2
in 2719
their 2
housekeeping 2
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
no 896
nothing 5
at 272
all 162
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
good 28
management 3
depend 17
upon 1
it 67
yes 16
yes 16
they 5
will 39
take 18
care 47
not 85
to 805
outrun 3
their 2
income 5
they 5
will 39
never 3
be 1200
distressed 1
for 484
money 17
well 24
much 2
good 28
may 49
it 67
do 814
them 9
and 51
so 797
i 4330
suppose 4
they 5
often 4
talk 18
of 109
having 1
when 6
your 4
father 12
is 124
dead 39
they 5
look 14
upon 1
it 67
as 509
quite 1
their 2
own 9
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
whenever 1
that 11
happens 4
it 67
was 93
a 6799
subject 11
which 2
they 5
could 2
not 85
mention 5
before 2
me 1041
no 896
it 67
would 5
have 11
been 1
strange 8
if 8
they 5
had 11
but 82
i 4330
make 17
no 896
doubt 15
they 5
often 4
talk 18
of 109
it 67
between 1
themselves 1
well 24
if 8
they 5
can 287
be 1200
easy 2
with 34
an 970
estate 3
that 11
is 124
not 85
lawfully 1
their 2
own 9
so 797
much 2
the 193
better 7
i 4330
should 7
be 1200
ashamed 2
of 109
having 1
one 19
that 11
was 93
only 1
entailed 1
on 86
me 1041
chapter 3
the 193
first 8
week 20
of 109
their 2
return 14
was 93
soon 3
gone 4
the 193
second 16
began 1
it 67
was 93
the 193
last 7
of 109
the 193
regiment's 1
stay 7
in 2719
and 51
all 162
the 193
young 9
ladies 1
in 2719
the 193
were 5
drooping 1
apace 1
the 193
dejection 2
was 93
almost 1
universal 10
the 193
elder 7
miss 71
alone 1
were 5
still 13
able 3
to 805
eat 15
drink 9
and 51
sleep 33
and 51
pursue 6
the 193
usual 3
course 10
of 109
their 2
employments 1
very 1
frequently 1
were 5
they 5
reproached 1
for 484
this 6
insensibility 2
by 57
kitty 2
and 51
lydia 4
whose 1
own 9
misery 2
was 93
extreme 8
and 51
who 79
could 2
not 85
comprehend 4
such 2
hard 70
in 2719
any 17
of 109
the 193
family 2
good 28
heaven 9
what 14
is 124
to 805
become 2
of 109
us 70
what 14
are 12
we 444
to 805
do 814
would 5
they 5
often 4
exclaim 4
in 2719
the 193
bitterness 2
of 109
woe 10
how 27
can 287
you 29
be 1200
smiling 2
so 797
lizzy 2
their 2
affectionate 2
mother 21
shared 1
all 162
their 2
grief 3
she 199
remembered 1
what 14
she 199
had 11
herself 1
endured 1
on 86
a 6799
similar 5
occasion 7
five 5
and 51
twenty 2
years 1
ago 15
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
said 1
she 199
i 4330
cried 1
for 484
two 14
days 1
together 3
when 6
colonel 5
miller's 1
regiment 8
went 1
away 1
i 4330
thought 11
i 4330
should 7
have 11
broken 6
my 90
heart 57
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
i 4330
shall 12
break 43
mine 26
said 1
lydia 4
if 8
one 19
could 2
but 82
go 500
to 805
brighton 2
observed 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
oh 17
yes 16
if 8
one 19
could 2
but 82
go 500
to 805
brighton 2
but 82
papa 13
is 124
so 797
disagreeable 3
a 6799
little 6
sea 158
bathing 2
would 5
set 40
me 1041
up 194
forever 3
and 51
my 90
aunt 6
phillips 1
is 124
sure 11
it 67
would 5
do 814
me 1041
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
good 28
added 1
kitty 2
such 2
were 5
the 193
kind 31
of 109
lamentations 1
resounding 2
perpetually 1
through 4
house 87
elizabeth 5
tried 1
to 805
be 1200
diverted 1
by 57
them 9
but 82
all 162
sense 8
of 109
pleasure 5
was 93
lost 1
in 2719
shame 14
she 199
felt 5
anew 1
the 193
justice 3
of 109
mr 5
darcy's 1
objections 1
and 51
never 3
had 11
she 199
been 1
so 797
much 2
disposed 1
to 805
pardon 10
his 43
interference 2
in 2719
the 193
views 1
of 109
his 43
friend 14
but 82
the 193
gloom 8
of 109
prospect 13
was 93
shortly 1
cleared 1
away 1
for 484
she 199
received 1
an 970
invitation 6
from 2
mrs 1
forster 1
the 193
wife 6
of 109
the 193
colonel 5
of 109
the 193
regiment 8
to 805
accompany 2
her 181
to 805
brighton 2
this 6
invaluable 1
friend 14
was 93
a 6799
very 1
young 9
woman 21
and 51
very 1
lately 1
married 3
a 6799
resemblance 3
in 2719
good 28
and 51
good 28
spirits 1
had 11
recommended 1
her 181
and 51
lydia 4
to 805
each 1
other 5
and 51
out 365
of 109
their 2
three 12
acquaintance 5
they 5
had 11
been 1
intimate 5
two 14
the 193
rapture 3
of 109
lydia 4
on 86
this 6
occasion 7
her 181
adoration 2
of 109
mrs 1
forster 1
the 193
delight 8
of 109
mrs 1
bennet 1
and 51
the 193
mortification 2
of 109
kitty 2
are 12
scarcely 1
to 805
be 1200
described 1
wholly 1
inattentive 4
to 805
her 181
sister's 1
feelings 1
lydia 4
flew 1
about 1
the 193
house 87
in 2719
restless 4
ecstasy 2
calling 3
for 484
everyone's 1
congratulations 1
and 51
laughing 6
and 51
talking 1
with 34
more 11
violence 2
than 22
ever 33
whilst 1
the 193
luckless 1
kitty 2
continued 1
in 2719
the 193
repined 1
at 272
her 181
fate 8
in 2719
terms 1
as 509
unreasonable 3
as 509
her 181
accent 14
was 93
peevish 4
i 4330
cannot 1
see 70
why 4
mrs 1
forster 1
should 7
not 85
ask 6
me 1041
as 509
well 24
as 509
lydia 4
said 1
she 199
though 12
i 4330
am 392
not 85
her 181
particular 13
friend 14
i 4330
have 11
just 24
as 509
much 2
right 31
to 805
be 1200
asked 1
as 509
she 199
has 41
and 51
more 11
too 50
for 484
i 4330
am 392
two 14
years 1
older 1
in 2719
vain 8
did 23
elizabeth 5
attempt 5
to 805
make 17
her 181
reasonable 3
and 51
jane 8
to 805
make 17
her 181
resigned 2
as 509
for 484
elizabeth 5
herself 1
this 6
invitation 6
was 93
so 797
far 91
from 2
exciting 2
in 2719
her 181
the 193
same 5
feelings 1
as 509
in 2719
her 181
mother 21
and 51
lydia 4
that 11
she 199
considered 1
it 67
as 509
the 193
death 19
warrant 10
of 109
all 162
possibility 2
of 109
common 23
sense 8
for 484
the 193
latter 3
and 51
detestable 1
as 509
such 2
a 6799
step 48
must 28
make 17
her 181
were 5
it 67
known 1
she 199
could 2
not 85
help 23
secretly 1
advising 1
her 181
father 12
not 85
to 805
let 50
her 181
go 500
she 199
represented 1
to 805
him 9
all 162
the 193
improprieties 1
of 109
general 22
the 193
little 6
advantage 6
she 199
could 2
derive 3
from 2
the 193
friendship 3
of 109
such 2
a 6799
woman 21
as 509
mrs 1
forster 1
and 51
the 193
probability 2
of 109
her 181
being 3
yet 4
more 11
imprudent 2
with 34
such 2
a 6799
companion 10
at 272
brighton 2
where 21
the 193
temptations 1
must 28
be 1200
greater 1
than 22
at 272
home 90
he 962
heard 1
her 181
attentively 1
and 51
then 5
said 1
lydia 4
will 39
never 3
be 1200
easy 2
until 1
she 199
has 41
exposed 1
herself 1
in 2719
some 30
public 18
place 29
or 333
other 5
and 51
we 444
can 287
never 3
expect 20
her 181
to 805
do 814
it 67
with 34
so 797
little 6
expense 3
or 333
inconvenience 4
to 805
her 181
family 2
as 509
under 288
the 193
present 20
circumstances 1
if 8
you 29
were 5
aware 3
said 1
elizabeth 5
of 109
the 193
very 1
great 12
disadvantage 6
to 805
us 70
all 162
which 2
must 28
arise 3
from 2
the 193
public 18
notice 8
of 109
unguarded 1
and 51
imprudent 2
manner 8
nay 6
which 2
has 41
already 1
arisen 1
from 2
it 67
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
you 29
would 5
judge 6
differently 1
in 2719
the 193
affair 3
already 1
arisen 1
repeated 2
mr 5
bennet 1
what 14
has 41
she 199
frightened 1
away 1
some 30
of 109
your 4
lovers 1
poor 11
little 6
lizzy 2
but 82
do 814
not 85
be 1200
cast 54
down 90
such 2
squeamish 4
youths 1
as 509
cannot 1
bear 30
to 805
be 1200
connected 1
with 34
a 6799
little 6
absurdity 2
are 12
not 85
worth 15
a 6799
regret 9
come 36
let 50
me 1041
see 70
the 193
list 27
of 109
pitiful 2
fellows 4
who 79
have 11
been 1
kept 1
aloof 4
by 57
folly 2
indeed 1
you 29
are 12
mistaken 2
i 4330
have 11
no 896
such 2
injuries 1
to 805
resent 11
it 67
is 124
not 85
of 109
particular 13
but 82
of 109
general 22
evils 1
which 2
i 4330
am 392
now 10
complaining 1
our 3
importance 2
our 3
respectability 2
in 2719
the 193
world 12
must 28
be 1200
affected 2
by 57
the 193
wild 36
volatility 2
the 193
assurance 3
and 51
disdain 7
of 109
all 162
restraint 3
which 2
mark 47
character 16
excuse 4
me 1041
for 484
i 4330
must 28
speak 12
plainly 1
if 8
you 29
my 90
dear 15
father 12
will 39
not 85
take 18
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
checking 1
her 181
exuberant 2
spirits 1
and 51
of 109
teaching 3
her 181
that 11
her 181
present 20
pursuits 1
are 12
not 85
to 805
be 1200
the 193
business 13
of 109
her 181
life 44
she 199
will 39
soon 3
be 1200
beyond 1
the 193
reach 6
of 109
amendment 3
her 181
character 16
will 39
be 1200
fixed 2
and 51
she 199
will 39
at 272
sixteen 6
be 1200
the 193
most 3
determined 2
flirt 13
that 11
ever 33
made 13
herself 1
or 333
her 181
family 2
ridiculous 4
a 6799
flirt 13
too 50
in 2719
the 193
worst 6
and 51
meanest 1
degree 3
of 109
flirtation 3
without 1
any 17
attraction 3
beyond 1
youth 7
and 51
a 6799
tolerable 1
person 33
and 51
from 2
the 193
ignorance 2
and 51
emptiness 2
of 109
her 181
mind 25
wholly 1
unable 1
to 805
ward 19
off 100
any 17
portion 5
of 109
that 11
universal 10
contempt 8
which 2
her 181
rage 4
for 484
admiration 2
will 39
excite 10
in 2719
this 6
danger 7
kitty 2
also 3
is 124
comprehended 1
she 199
will 39
follow 11
wherever 1
lydia 4
leads 1
vain 8
ignorant 2
idle 10
and 51
absolutely 1
uncontrolled 1
oh 17
my 90
dear 15
father 12
can 287
you 29
suppose 4
it 67
possible 3
that 11
they 5
will 39
not 85
be 1200
censured 1
and 51
despised 1
wherever 1
they 5
are 12
known 1
and 51
that 11
their 2
sisters 1
will 39
not 85
be 1200
often 4
involved 1
in 2719
the 193
disgrace 8
mr 5
bennet 1
saw 24
that 11
her 181
whole 26
heart 57
was 93
in 2719
the 193
subject 11
and 51
affectionately 1
taking 4
her 181
hand 137
said 1
in 2719
reply 3
do 814
not 85
make 17
yourself 1
uneasy 1
my 90
love 29
wherever 1
you 29
and 51
jane 8
are 12
known 1
you 29
must 28
be 1200
respected 1
and 51
valued 1
and 51
you 29
will 39
not 85
appear 7
to 805
less 19
advantage 6
for 484
having 1
a 6799
couple 7
of 109
or 333
i 4330
may 49
say 7
three 12
very 1
silly 2
sisters 1
we 444
shall 12
have 11
no 896
peace 21
at 272
if 8
lydia 4
does 5
not 85
go 500
to 805
brighton 2
let 50
her 181
go 500
then 5
colonel 5
forster 1
is 124
a 6799
sensible 3
man 342
and 51
will 39
keep 11
her 181
out 365
of 109
any 17
real 47
mischief 2
and 51
she 199
is 124
luckily 1
too 50
poor 11
to 805
be 1200

that 11

her 181

disappointed 1

a 6799
visit 14
to 805
brighton 2
comprised 1
every 10
possibility 2
of 109
earthly 1
happiness 2
she 199
saw 24
with 34
the 193
creative 6
eye 57
of 109
fancy 5
the 193
streets 1
of 109
that 11
gay 9
bathing 2
place 29
covered 1
with 34
officers 1
she 199
saw 24
herself 1
the 193
object 26
of 109
attention 3
to 805
tens 19
and 51
to 805
scores 1
of 109
them 9
at 272
present 20
unknown 3
she 199
saw 24
all 162
the 193
glories 1
of 109
the 193
camp 47
its 2
tents 1
stretched 1
forth 8
in 2719
beauteous 2
uniformity 2
of 109
lines 4
crowded 1
with 34
the 193
young 9

the 193
gay 9
and 51
dazzling 2
with 34
scarlet 2
and 51
to 805
complete 8
the 193
view 18
she 199
saw 24
herself 1
seated 1
beneath 1
a 6799
tent 20
tenderly 1
flirting 1
with 34
at 272
least 3
six 24
officers 1
at 272
once 2
had 11
she 199
known 1
her 181
sister 9
sought 1
to 805
tear 26
her 181
from 2
such 2
prospects 1
and 51
such 2
realities 1
as 509
these 4
what 14
would 5
have 11
been 1
her 181
sensations 1
they 5
could 2
have 11
been 1
understood 1
only 1
by 57
her 181
mother 21
who 79
might 9
have 11
felt 5
nearly 1
the 193
same 5
going 3
to 805
brighton 2
was 93
all 162
that 11
consoled 1
her 181
for 484
her 181
melancholy 2
conviction 3
of 109
her 181
husband's 1
never 3
intending 1
to 805
go 500
there 21
himself 1
but 82
they 5
were 5
entirely 1
ignorant 2
of 109
what 14
had 11
passed 1
and 51
their 2
raptures 1
continued 1
with 34
little 6
intermission 3
to 805
the 193
very 1
day 27
of 109
leaving 3
home 90
elizabeth 5
was 93
now 10
to 805
see 70
mr 5
for 484
the 193
last 7
time 45
having 1
been 1
frequently 1
in 2719
company 2
with 34
him 9
since 7
her 181
return 14
agitation 3
was 93
pretty 3
well 24
over 596
the 193
agitations 1
of 109
former 3
partiality 2
entirely 1
so 797
she 199
had 11
even 36
to 805
detect 13
in 2719
the 193
very 1
gentleness 2
which 2
had 11
first 8
delighted 2
her 181
an 970
affectation 3
and 51
a 6799
sameness 2
to 805
disgust 7
and 51
weary 2
in 2719
his 43
present 20
to 805
herself 1
moreover 1
she 199
had 11
a 6799
fresh 22
source 4
of 109
displeasure 2
for 484
the 193
inclination 3
he 962
soon 3
testified 1
of 109
renewing 1
those 1
intentions 1
which 2
had 11
marked 2
the 193
early 1
part 102
of 109
their 2
acquaintance 5
could 2
only 1
serve 9
after 48
what 14
had 11
since 7
passed 1
to 805
provoke 6
her 181
she 199
lost 1
all 162
concern 6
for 484
him 9
in 2719
finding 4
herself 1
thus 1
selected 1
as 509
the 193
object 26
of 109
such 2
idle 10
and 51
frivolous 4
gallantry 2
and 51
while 4
she 199
steadily 1
repressed 1
it 67
could 2
not 85
but 82
feel 11
the 193
reproof 5
contained 1
in 2719
his 43
believing 1
that 11
however 1
long 49
and 51
for 484
whatever 1
cause 14
his 43
attentions 1
had 11
been 1
withdrawn 1
her 181
vanity 2
would 5
be 1200
gratified 1
and 51
her 181
preference 3
secured 1
at 272
any 17
time 45
by 57
their 2
renewal 3
on 86
the 193
very 1
last 7
day 27
of 109
the 193
regiment's 1
remaining 1
at 272
he 962
dined 1
with 34
other 5
of 109
the 193
officers 1
at 272
and 51
so 797
little 6
was 93
elizabeth 5
disposed 1
to 805
part 102
from 2
him 9
in 2719
good 28
that 11
on 86
his 43
making 4
some 30
inquiry 2
as 509
to 805
the 193
manner 8
in 2719
which 2
her 181
time 45
had 11
passed 1
at 272
she 199
mentioned 1
colonel 5
and 51
mr 5
darcy's 1
having 1
both 8
spent 1
three 12
weeks 2
at 272
and 51
asked 1
him 9
if 8
he 962
was 93
acquainted 1
with 34
the 193
former 3
he 962
looked 1
surprised 1
displeased 1
alarmed 1
but 82
with 34
a 6799
moment's 1
recollection 3
and 51
a 6799
returning 1
smile 7
replied 1
that 11
he 962
had 11
formerly 1
seen 1
him 9
often 4
and 51
after 48
observing 1
that 11
he 962
was 93
a 6799
very 1
man 342
asked 1
her 181
how 27
she 199
had 11
liked 1
him 9
her 181
answer 8
was 93
warmly 1
in 2719
his 43
with 34
an 970
air 129
of 109
indifference 2
he 962
soon 3
afterwards 1
added 1
how 27
long 49
did 23
you 29
say 7
he 962
was 93
at 272
nearly 1
three 12
weeks 2
and 51
you 29
saw 24
him 9
frequently 1
yes 16
almost 1
every 10
day 27
his 43
manners 1
are 12
very 1
different 11
from 2
his 43
cousin's 1
yes 16
very 1
different 11
but 82
i 4330
think 8
mr 5
darcy 2
improves 1
upon 1
acquaintance 5
indeed 1
cried 1
mr 5
with 34
a 6799
look 14
which 2
did 23
not 85
escape 10
her 181
and 51
pray 9
may 49
i 4330
ask 6
but 82
checking 1
himself 1
he 962
added 1
in 2719
a 6799
gayer 1
tone 12
is 124
it 67
in 2719
address 9
that 11
he 962
improves 1
has 41
he 962
deigned 1
to 805
add 54
aught 3
of 109
civility 2
to 805
his 43
ordinary 2
style 4
for 484
i 4330
dare 15
not 85
hope 16
he 962
continued 1
in 2719
a 6799
lower 9
and 51
more 11
serious 4
tone 12
that 11
he 962
is 124
improved 1
in 2719
essentials 1
oh 17
no 896
said 1
elizabeth 5
in 2719
essentials 1
i 4330
believe 6
he 962
is 124
very 1
much 2
what 14
he 962
ever 33
was 93
while 4
she 199
spoke 14
looked 1
as 509
if 8
scarcely 1
knowing 3
whether 1
to 805
rejoice 3
over 596
her 181
words 5
or 333
to 805
distrust 7
their 2
meaning 11
there 21
was 93
a 6799
something 3
in 2719
her 181
countenance 4
which 2
made 13
him 9
listen 9
with 34
an 970
apprehensive 4
and 51
anxious 4
attention 3
while 4
she 199
added 1
when 6
i 4330
said 1
that 11
he 962
improved 1
on 86
acquaintance 5
i 4330
did 23
not 85
mean 36
that 11
his 43
mind 25
or 333
his 43
manners 1
were 5
in 2719
a 6799
state 41
of 109
improvement 3
but 82
that 11
from 2
knowing 3
him 9
better 7
his 43
disposition 3
was 93
better 7
understood 1
alarm 9
now 10
appeared 1
in 2719
a 6799
heightened 1
complexion 5
and 51
agitated 1
look 14
for 484
a 6799
few 6
minutes 2
he 962
was 93
silent 6
till 14
shaking 1
off 100
his 43
embarrassment 3
he 962
turned 1
to 805
her 181
again 2
and 51
said 1
in 2719
the 193
gentlest 1
of 109
accents 1
you 29
who 79
so 797
well 24
know 12
my 90
feeling 4
towards 1
mr 5
darcy 2
will 39
readily 1
comprehend 4
how 27
sincerely 1
i 4330
must 28
rejoice 3
that 11
he 962
is 124
wise 17
enough 2
to 805
assume 3
even 36
the 193
appearance 3
of 109
what 14
is 124
right 31
his 43
pride 6
in 2719
that 11
direction 5
may 49
be 1200
of 109
service 13
if 8
not 85
to 805
himself 1
to 805
many 2
others 1
for 484
it 67
must 28
only 1
deter 39
him 9
from 2
such 2
foul 13
misconduct 5
as 509
i 4330
have 11
suffered 1
by 57
i 4330
only 1
fear 14
that 11
the 193
sort 14
of 109
cautiousness 2
to 805
which 2
you 29
i 4330
imagine 3
have 11
been 1
alluding 1
is 124
merely 1
adopted 1
on 86
his 43
visits 1
to 805
his 43
aunt 6
of 109
whose 1
good 28
opinion 4
and 51
he 962
stands 4
much 2
in 2719
awe 10
his 43
fear 14
of 109
her 181
has 41
always 1
operated 1
i 4330
know 12
when 6
they 5
were 5
together 3
and 51
a 6799
good 28
deal 13
is 124
to 805
be 1200
imputed 1
to 805
his 43
wish 13
of 109
forwarding 1
the 193
match 25
with 34
miss 71
de 2452
which 2
i 4330
am 392
certain 5
he 962
has 41
very 1
much 2
at 272
heart 57
elizabeth 5
could 2
not 85
repress 10
a 6799
smile 7
at 272
this 6
but 82
she 199
answered 1
only 1
by 57
a 6799
slight 10
inclination 3
of 109
the 193
head 140
she 199
saw 24
that 11
he 962
wanted 1
to 805
engage 6
her 181
on 86
the 193
old 21
subject 11
of 109
his 43
grievances 1
and 51
she 199
was 93
in 2719
no 896
to 805
indulge 8
him 9
the 193
rest 110
of 109
the 193
evening 3
passed 1
with 34
the 193
appearance 3
on 86
his 43
side 74
of 109
usual 3
cheerfulness 2
but 82
with 34
no 896
further 8
attempt 5
to 805
distinguish 5
elizabeth 5
and 51
they 5
parted 1
at 272
last 7
with 34
mutual 4
civility 2
and 51
possibly 1
a 6799
mutual 4
desire 6
of 109
never 3
meeting 6
again 2
when 6
the 193
party 3
broke 15
up 194
lydia 4
returned 1
with 34
mrs 1
forster 1
to 805
from 2
whence 1
they 5
were 5
to 805
set 40
out 365
early 1
the 193
next 2
morning 3
the 193
separation 3
between 1
her 181
and 51
her 181
family 2
was 93
rather 2
noisy 1
than 22
pathetic 2
kitty 2
was 93
the 193
only 1
one 19
who 79
shed 4
tears 1
but 82
she 199
did 23
weep 14
from 2
vexation 3
and 51
envy 4
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
diffuse 6
in 2719
her 181
good 28
wishes 1
for 484
the 193
felicity 2
of 109
her 181
daughter 4
and 51
impressive 4
in 2719
her 181
injunctions 1
that 11
she 199
should 7
not 85
miss 71
the 193
opportunity 2
of 109
enjoying 1
herself 1
as 509
much 2
as 509
possible 3
advice 2
which 2
there 21
was 93
every 10
reason 13
to 805
believe 6
would 5
be 1200
well 24
attended 1
to 805
and 51
in 2719
the 193
clamorous 1
happiness 2
of 109
lydia 4
herself 1
in 2719
bidding 2
farewell 3
the 193
more 11
gentle 18
adieus 1
of 109
her 181
sisters 1
were 5
uttered 1
without 1
being 3
heard 1
chapter 3
had 11
elizabeth's 1
opinion 4
been 1
all 162
drawn 1
from 2
her 181
own 9
family 2
she 199
could 2
not 85
have 11
formed 1
a 6799
very 1
pleasing 3
opinion 4
of 109
conjugal 2
felicity 2
or 333
domestic 12
comfort 14
her 181
father 12
captivated 1
by 57
youth 7
and 51
beauty 2
and 51
that 11
appearance 3
of 109
good 28
which 2
youth 7
and 51
beauty 2
generally 1
give 15
had 11
married 3
a 6799
woman 21
whose 1
weak 20
understanding 4
and 51
illiberal 4
mind 25
had 11
very 1
early 1
in 2719
their 2
marriage 6
put 47
an 970
end 92
to 805
all 162
real 47
affection 5
for 484
her 181
respect 18
esteem 5
and 51
confidence 3
had 11
vanished 1
for 484
ever 33
and 51
all 162
his 43
views 1
of 109
domestic 12
happiness 2
were 5
overthrown 1
but 82
mr 5
bennet 1
was 93
not 85
of 109
a 6799
disposition 3
to 805
seek 6
comfort 14
for 484
the 193
disappointment 3
which 2
his 43
own 9
imprudence 2
had 11
brought 1
on 86
in 2719
any 17
of 109
those 1
pleasures 1
which 2
too 50
often 4
console 4
the 193
unfortunate 4
for 484
their 2
folly 2
or 333
their 2
vice 14
he 962
was 93
fond 17
of 109
the 193
country 12
and 51
of 109
books 15
and 51
from 2
these 4
tastes 1
had 11
arisen 1
his 43
principal 7
enjoyments 1
to 805
his 43
wife 6
he 962
was 93
very 1
little 6
otherwise 1
indebted 3
than 22
as 509
her 181
ignorance 2
and 51
folly 2
had 11
contributed 1
to 805
his 43
amusement 3
this 6
is 124
not 85
the 193
sort 14
of 109
happiness 2
which 2
a 6799
man 342
would 5
in 2719
general 22
wish 13
to 805
owe 5
to 805
his 43
wife 6
but 82
where 21
other 5
powers 1
of 109
entertainment 3
are 12

from 2
such 2
as 509
are 12
given 3
elizabeth 5
however 1
had 11
never 3
been 1
blind 22
to 805
the 193
impropriety 2
of 109
her 181
father's 1
as 509
a 6799
husband 10
she 199
had 11
always 1
seen 1
it 67
with 34
pain 42
but 82
respecting 1
his 43
abilities 1
and 51
grateful 4
for 484
his 43
affectionate 2
treatment 3
of 109
herself 1
she 199
to 805
forget 8
what 14
she 199
could 2
not 85
overlook 5
and 51
to 805
banish 6
from 2
her 181
thoughts 1
that 11
continual 2
breach 5
of 109
conjugal 2
obligation 3
and 51
decorum 2
which 2
in 2719
exposing 1
his 43
wife 6
to 805
the 193
contempt 8
of 109
her 181
own 9
children 1
was 93
so 797
highly 1
reprehensible 1
but 82
she 199
had 11
never 3
felt 5
so 797
strongly 1
as 509
now 10
the 193
disadvantages 1
which 2
must 28
attend 15
the 193
children 1
of 109
so 797
unsuitable 1
a 6799
marriage 6

fully 1
aware 3

ill 84
judged 1
a 6799
direction 5
of 109
talents 1
talents 1
which 2
rightly 1
used 1
might 9
at 272
least 3
have 11
preserved 1
the 193
respectability 2
of 109
his 43
daughters 1
even 36
if 8
incapable 1
of 109
enlarging 1
the 193
mind 25
of 109
his 43
wife 6
when 6
elizabeth 5
had 11
rejoiced 1
over 596
departure 3
she 199
found 18
little 6
other 5
cause 14
for 484
satisfaction 3
in 2719
the 193
loss 3
of 109
the 193
regiment 8
their 2
parties 1
abroad 1
were 5
less 19
varied 1
than 22
before 2
and 51
at 272
home 90
she 199
had 11
a 6799
mother 21
and 51
sister 9
whose 1
constant 7
at 272
the 193
dullness 2
of 109
everything 2
around 1
them 9
threw 1
a 6799
real 47
gloom 8
over 596
their 2
domestic 12
circle 7
and 51
though 12
kitty 2
might 9
in 2719
time 45
regain 4
her 181
natural 18
degree 3
of 109
sense 8
since 7
the 193
disturbers 1
of 109
her 181
brain 32
were 5
removed 1
her 181
other 5
sister 9
from 2
whose 1
disposition 3
greater 1
evil 15
might 9
be 1200
apprehended 1
was 93
likely 1
to 805
be 1200
hardened 1
in 2719
all 162
her 181
folly 2
and 51
assurance 3
by 57
a 6799
situation 3
of 109
such 2
double 14
danger 7
as 509
a 6799
watering 1
place 29
and 51
a 6799
camp 47
upon 1
the 193
whole 26
therefore 1
she 199
found 18
what 14
has 41
been 1
sometimes 1
found 18
before 2
that 11
an 970
event 18
to 805
which 2
she 199
had 11
been 1
looking 1
with 34
impatient 2
desire 6
did 23
not 85
in 2719
taking 4
place 29
bring 6
all 162
the 193
satisfaction 3
she 199
had 11
promised 1
herself 1
it 67
was 93
consequently 1
necessary 2
to 805
name 17
some 30
other 5
period 16
for 484
the 193
commencement 3
of 109
actual 11
felicity 2
to 805
have 11
some 30
other 5
point 22
on 86
which 2
her 181
wishes 1
and 51
hopes 1
might 9
be 1200
fixed 2
and 51
by 57
again 2
enjoying 1
the 193
pleasure 5
of 109
anticipation 3
console 4
herself 1
for 484
the 193
present 20
and 51
prepare 5
for 484
another 1
disappointment 3
her 181
tour 23
to 805
the 193
lakes 2
was 93
now 10
the 193
object 26
of 109
her 181
happiest 1
thoughts 1
it 67
was 93
her 181
best 37
consolation 3
for 484
all 162
the 193
uncomfortable 1
hours 1
which 2
the 193
of 109
her 181
mother 21
and 51
kitty 2
made 13
inevitable 2
and 51
could 2
she 199
have 11
included 1
jane 8
in 2719
the 193
scheme 7
every 10
part 102
of 109
it 67
would 5
have 11
been 1
perfect 24
but 82
it 67
is 124
fortunate 2
thought 11
she 199
that 11
i 4330
have 11
something 3
to 805
wish 13
for 484
were 5
the 193
whole 26
arrangement 3
complete 8
my 90
disappointment 3
would 5
be 1200
certain 5
but 82
here 31
by 57
carrying 1
with 34
me 1041
one 19
ceaseless 4
source 4
of 109
regret 9
in 2719
my 90
sister's 1
absence 3
i 4330
may 49
reasonably 1
hope 16
to 805
have 11
all 162
my 90
expectations 1
of 109
pleasure 5
a 6799
scheme 7
of 109
which 2
every 10
part 102
promises 1
delight 8
can 287
never 3
be 1200
successful 2
and 51
general 22
disappointment 3
is 124
only 1
warded 1
off 100
by 57
the 193
of 109
some 30
little 6
peculiar 5
vexation 3
when 6
lydia 4
went 1
away 1
she 199
promised 1
to 805
write 5
very 1
often 4
and 51
very 1
minutely 1
to 805
her 181
mother 21
and 51
kitty 2
but 82
her 181
letters 1
were 5
always 1
long 49
expected 1
and 51
always 1
very 1
short 62
those 1
to 805
her 181
mother 21
contained 1
little 6
else 2
than 22
that 11
they 5
were 5
just 24
returned 1
from 2
the 193
library 2
where 21
such 2
and 51
such 2
officers 1
had 11
attended 1
them 9
and 51
where 21
she 199
had 11
seen 1
such 2
beautiful 2
ornaments 1
as 509
made 13
her 181
quite 1
wild 36
that 11
she 199
had 11
a 6799
new 115
gown 5
or 333
a 6799
new 115
parasol 3
which 2
she 199
would 5
have 11
described 1
more 11
fully 1
but 82
was 93
obliged 1
to 805
leave 14
off 100
in 2719
a 6799
violent 2
hurry 3
as 509
mrs 1
forster 1
called 1
her 181
and 51
they 5
were 5
going 3
off 100
to 805
the 193
camp 47
and 51
from 2
her 181
correspondence 3
with 34
her 181
sister 9
there 21
was 93
still 13
less 19
to 805
be 1200
for 484
her 181
letters 1
to 805
kitty 2
though 12
rather 2
longer 1
were 5
much 2
too 50
full 16
of 109
lines 4
under 288
the 193
words 5
to 805
be 1200
made 13
public 18
after 48
the 193
first 8
fortnight 4
or 333
three 12
weeks 2
of 109
her 181
absence 3
health 12
good 28
and 51
cheerfulness 2
began 1
to 805
reappear 7
at 272
everything 2
wore 1
a 6799
happier 1
aspect 3
the 193
families 1
who 79
had 11
been 1
in 2719
town 27
for 484
the 193
winter 13
came 36
back 182
again 2
and 51
summer 13
finery 2
and 51
summer 13
engagements 1
arose 1
mrs 1
bennet 1
was 93
restored 1
to 805
her 181
usual 3
querulous 4
serenity 2
and 51
by 57
the 193
middle 14
of 109
june 5
kitty 2
was 93
so 797
much 2
recovered 1
as 509
to 805
be 1200
able 3
to 805
enter 23
without 1
tears 1
an 970
event 18
of 109
such 2
happy 1
promise 4
as 509
to 805
make 17
elizabeth 5
hope 16
that 11
by 57
the 193
following 3
christmas 9
she 199
might 9
be 1200
so 797
tolerably 1
reasonable 3
as 509
not 85
to 805
mention 5
an 970
officer 3
above 3
once 2
a 6799
day 27
unless 1
by 57
some 30
cruel 9
and 51
malicious 4
arrangement 3
at 272
the 193
war 145
office 11
another 1
regiment 8
should 7
be 1200
quartered 1
in 2719
the 193
time 45
fixed 2
for 484
the 193
beginning 3
of 109
their 2
northern 5
tour 23
was 93
now 10
fast 29
approaching 1
and 51
a 6799
fortnight 4
only 1
was 93
wanting 1
of 109
it 67
when 6
a 6799
letter 20
arrived 1
from 2
mrs 1
which 2
at 272
once 2
delayed 1
its 2
commencement 3
and 51
curtailed 1
its 2
extent 3
mr 5
would 5
be 1200
prevented 1
by 57
business 13
from 2
setting 3
out 365
till 14
a 6799
fortnight 4
later 9
in 2719
july 2
and 51
must 28
be 1200
in 2719
london 5
again 2
within 3
a 6799
month 6
and 51
as 509
that 11
left 19
too 50
short 62
a 6799
period 16
for 484
them 9
to 805
go 500
so 797
far 91
and 51
see 70
so 797
much 2
as 509
they 5
had 11
proposed 1
or 333
at 272
least 3
to 805
see 70
it 67
with 34
the 193
leisure 8
and 51
comfort 14
they 5
had 11
built 1
on 86
they 5
were 5
obliged 1
to 805
give 15
up 194
the 193
lakes 2
and 51
substitute 4
a 6799
more 11
contracted 1
tour 23
and 51
according 2
to 805
the 193
present 20
plan 61
were 5
to 805
go 500
no 896
farther 2
northwards 1
than 22
in 2719
that 11
county 3
there 21
was 93
enough 2
to 805
be 1200
seen 1
to 805
occupy 2
the 193
chief 14
of 109
their 2
three 12
weeks 2
and 51
to 805
mrs 1
it 67
had 11
a 6799
peculiarly 1
strong 16
attraction 3
the 193
town 27
where 21
she 199
had 11
formerly 1
passed 1
some 30
years 1
of 109
her 181
life 44
and 51
where 21
they 5
were 5
now 10
to 805
spend 11
a 6799
few 6
days 1
was 93
probably 1
as 509
great 12
an 970
object 26
of 109
her 181
curiosity 2
as 509
all 162
the 193
celebrated 1
beauties 1
of 109
or 333
the 193
peak 6
elizabeth 5
was 93
excessively 1
disappointed 1
she 199
had 11
set 40
her 181
heart 57
on 86
seeing 2
the 193
lakes 2
and 51
still 13
thought 11
there 21
might 9
have 11
been 1
time 45
enough 2
but 82
it 67
was 93
her 181
business 13
to 805
be 1200
satisfied 1
and 51
certainly 1
her 181
temper 22
to 805
be 1200
happy 1
and 51
all 162
was 93
soon 3
right 31
again 2
with 34
the 193
mention 5
of 109
there 21
were 5
many 2
ideas 1
connected 1
it 67
was 93
impossible 2
for 484
her 181
to 805
see 70
the 193
word 26
without 1
thinking 2
of 109
and 51
its 2
owner 5
but 82
surely 1
said 1
she 199
i 4330
may 49
enter 23
his 43
county 3
with 34
impunity 2
and 51
rob 65
it 67
of 109
a 6799
few 6
petrified 1
spars 9
without 1
his 43
perceiving 1
me 1041
the 193
period 16
of 109
expectation 3
was 93
now 10
doubled 3
four 26
weeks 2
were 5
to 805
pass 66
away 1
before 2
her 181
uncle 18
and 51
aunt's 1
arrival 3
but 82
they 5
did 23
pass 66
away 1
and 51
mr 5
and 51
mrs 1
with 34
their 2
four 26
children 1
did 23
at 272
length 14
appear 7
at 272
the 193
children 1
two 14
girls 1
of 109
six 24
and 51
eight 18
years 1
old 21
and 51
two 14
younger 1
boys 4
were 5
to 805
be 1200
left 19
under 288
the 193
particular 13

their 2

the 193
general 22

whose 1
steady 3
sense 8

sweetness 2
of 109
temper 22
exactly 1
adapted 1
her 181
for 484

every 10
way 27
teaching 3
them 9

only 1
one 19
night 61
at 272

set 40
off 100

next 2
morning 3
with 34
elizabeth 5
in 2719
pursuit 3
of 109
novelty 2

one 19
enjoyment 3
was 93
certain 5
that 11
of 109
suitableness 2
of 109
companions 3
a 6799
suitableness 2
which 2
comprehended 1
health 12

temper 22
to 805
bear 30
inconveniences 1
cheerfulness 2
to 805
enhance 8
every 10
pleasure 5

intelligence 2
which 2
might 9
supply 3
it 67
among 1
themselves 1

there 21
were 5
disappointments 1
abroad 1
it 67
is 124
not 85
the 193
object 26
of 109
this 6
work 87
to 805
give 15
a 6799
description 3
of 109

a 6799
small 14
part 102
of 109
is 124
all 162
the 193
present 20
concern 6
to 805
the 193
little 6
town 27
of 109
the 193
scene 5
of 109
mrs 1
former 3
residence 3
and 51
where 21
she 199
had 11
lately 1
learned 2
some 30
acquaintance 5
still 13
remained 1
they 5
bent 8
their 2
steps 7
after 48
having 1
seen 1
all 162
the 193
principal 7
wonders 1
of 109
the 193
country 12
and 51
within 3
five 5
miles 4
of 109
elizabeth 5
found 18
from 2
her 181
aunt 6
that 11
was 93
situated 1
it 67
was 93
not 85
in 2719
their 2
direct 30
road 38
nor 102
more 11
than 22
a 6799
mile 15
or 333
two 14
out 365
of 109
it 67
in 2719
talking 1
over 596
their 2
route 8
the 193
evening 3
before 2
mrs 1
expressed 1
an 970
inclination 3
to 805
see 70
the 193
place 29
again 2
mr 5
declared 1
his 43
willingness 2
and 51
elizabeth 5
was 93
applied 1
to 805
for 484
her 181
approbation 3
my 90
love 29
should 7
not 85
you 29
like 22
to 805
see 70
a 6799
place 29
of 109
which 2
you 29
have 11
heard 1
so 797
much 2
said 1
her 181
aunt 6
a 6799
place 29
too 50
with 34
which 2
so 797
many 2
of 109
your 4
acquaintances 3
are 12
connected 1
passed 1
all 162
his 43
youth 7
there 21
you 29
know 12
elizabeth 5
was 93
distressed 1
she 199
felt 5
that 11
she 199
had 11
no 896
business 13
at 272
and 51
was 93
obliged 1
to 805
assume 3
a 6799
disinclination 2
for 484
seeing 2
it 67
she 199
must 28
own 9
that 11
she 199
was 93
tired 6
of 109
seeing 2
great 12
houses 1
after 48
going 3
over 596
so 797
many 2
she 199
really 1
had 11
no 896

mrs 1
abused 1
her 181
stupidity 2
if 8
it 67
were 5
merely 1
a 6799
fine 17
house 87
richly 1
furnished 1
said 1
she 199
i 4330
should 7
not 85
care 47
about 1
it 67
myself 1
but 82
the 193
grounds 10
are 12
delightful 2
they 5
have 11
some 30
of 109
the 193
finest 1
woods 15
in 2719
the 193
country 12
elizabeth 5
said 1
no 896
more 11
but 82
her 181
mind 25
could 2
not 85
acquiesce 7
the 193
possibility 2
of 109
meeting 6
mr 5
darcy 2
while 4
viewing 3
the 193
place 29
instantly 1
occurred 1
it 67
would 5
be 1200
dreadful 4
she 199
blushed 1
at 272
the 193
very 1
idea 21
and 51
thought 11
it 67
would 5
be 1200
better 7
to 805
speak 12
openly 1
to 805
her 181
aunt 6
than 22
to 805
run 50
such 2
a 6799
risk 11
but 82
against 1
this 6
there 21
were 5
objections 1
and 51
she 199
finally 1
resolved 1
that 11
it 67
could 2
be 1200
the 193
last 7
resource 8
if 8
her 181
private 9
inquiries 1
to 805
the 193
absence 3
of 109
the 193
family 2
were 5
answered 1
accordingly 1
when 6
she 199
retired 1
at 272
night 61
she 199
asked 1
the 193
chambermaid 3
whether 1
were 5
not 85
a 6799
very 1
fine 17
place 29
what 14
was 93
the 193
name 17
of 109
its 2
proprietor 7
and 51
with 34
no 896
little 6
alarm 9
whether 1
the 193
family 2
were 5
down 90
for 484
the 193
summer 13
a 6799
most 3
welcome 4
negative 7
followed 1
the 193
last 7
question 16
and 51
her 181
alarms 1
now 10
being 3
removed 1
she 199
was 93
at 272
leisure 8
to 805
feel 11
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
curiosity 2
to 805
see 70
the 193
house 87
herself 1
and 51
when 6
the 193
subject 11
was 93
revived 1
the 193
next 2
morning 3
and 51
she 199
was 93
again 2
applied 1
to 805
could 2
readily 1
answer 8
and 51
with 34
a 6799
proper 9
air 129
of 109
indifference 2
that 11
she 199
had 11
not 85
really 1
any 17
dislike 4
to 805
the 193
scheme 7
to 805
therefore 1
they 5
were 5
to 805
go 500
chapter 3
elizabeth 5
as 509
they 5
drove 6
along 3
watched 1
for 484
the 193
first 8
appearance 3
of 109
woods 15
with 34
some 30
perturbation 3
and 51
when 6
at 272
length 14
they 5
turned 1
in 2719
at 272
the 193
lodge 7
her 181
spirits 1
were 5
in 2719
a 6799
high 54
flutter 6
the 193
park 18
was 93
very 1
large 11
and 51
contained 1
great 12
variety 2
of 109
ground 36
they 5
entered 1
it 67
in 2719
one 19
of 109
its 2
lowest 1
points 1
and 51
drove 6
for 484
some 30
time 45
through 4
a 6799
beautiful 2
wood 96
stretching 1
over 596
a 6799
wide 15
extent 3
elizabeth's 1
mind 25
was 93
too 50
full 16
for 484
conversation 8
but 82
she 199
saw 24
and 51
admired 1
every 10
remarkable 3
spot 24
and 51
point 22
of 109
view 18
they 5
gradually 1
ascended 1
for 484
half 23
a 6799
mile 15
and 51
then 5
found 18
themselves 1
at 272
the 193
top 71
of 109
a 6799
considerable 1
eminence 3
where 21
the 193
wood 96
ceased 1
and 51
the 193
eye 57
was 93
instantly 1
caught 1
by 57
house 87
situated 1
on 86
the 193
opposite 4
side 74
of 109
a 6799
valley 3
into 26
which 2
the 193
road 38
with 34
some 30
abruptness 2
wound 6
it 67
was 93
a 6799
large 11
handsome 6
stone 17
building 3
standing 3
well 24
on 86
rising 3
ground 36
and 51
backed 1
by 57
a 6799
ridge 7
of 109
high 54
woody 2
hills 4
and 51
in 2719
front 29
a 6799
stream 12
of 109
some 30
natural 18
importance 2
was 93
swelled 1
into 26
greater 1
but 82
without 1
any 17
artificial 4
appearance 3
its 2
banks 1
were 5
neither 1
formal 21
nor 102
falsely 1
adorned 1
elizabeth 5
was 93
delighted 2
she 199
had 11
never 3
seen 1
a 6799
place 29
for 484
which 2
nature 3
had 11
done 3
more 11
or 333
where 21
natural 18
beauty 2
had 11
been 1
so 797
little 6
counteracted 1
by 57
an 970
awkward 6
taste 15
they 5
were 5
all 162
of 109
them 9
warm 23
in 2719
their 2
admiration 2
and 51
at 272
that 11
moment 14
she 199
felt 5
that 11
to 805
be 1200
mistress 3
of 109
might 9
be 1200
something 3
they 5
descended 1
the 193
hill 22
crossed 1
the 193
bridge 21
and 51
drove 6
to 805
the 193
door 41
and 51
while 4
examining 1
the 193
nearer 1
aspect 3
of 109
the 193
house 87
all 162
her 181
apprehension 3
of 109
meeting 6
its 2
owner 5
returned 1
she 199
dreaded 1
lest 5
the 193
chambermaid 3
had 11
been 1
mistaken 2
on 86
applying 1
to 805
see 70
the 193
place 29
they 5
were 5
admitted 2
into 26
the 193
hall 45
and 51
elizabeth 5
as 509
they 5
waited 1
for 484
the 193
housekeeper 3
had 11
leisure 8
to 805
wonder 17
at 272
her 181
being 3
where 21
she 199
was 93
the 193
housekeeper 3
came 36
a 6799
respectable 1
looking 1
elderly 1
woman 21
much 2
less 19
fine 17
and 51
more 11
civil 15
than 22
she 199
had 11
any 17
notion 5
of 109
finding 4
her 181
they 5
followed 1
her 181
into 26
the 193
dining 1
it 67
was 93
a 6799
large 11
well 24
proportioned 1
room 22
handsomely 1
fitted 1
up 194
elizabeth 5
after 48
slightly 1
surveying 2
it 67
went 1
to 805
a 6799
window 12
to 805
enjoy 9
its 2
prospect 13
the 193
hill 22
crowned 1
with 34
wood 96
which 2
they 5
had 11
descended 1
receiving 1
increased 1
abruptness 2
from 2
the 193
distance 4
was 93
a 6799
beautiful 2
object 26
every 10
disposition 3
of 109
the 193
ground 36
was 93
good 28
and 51
she 199
looked 1
on 86
the 193
whole 26
scene 5
the 193
river 17
the 193
trees 1
scattered 1
on 86
its 2
banks 1
and 51
the 193
winding 2
of 109
the 193
valley 3
as 509
far 91
as 509
she 199
could 2
trace 13
it 67
with 34
delight 8
as 509
they 5
passed 1
into 26
other 5
rooms 1
these 4
objects 1
were 5
taking 4
different 11
positions 1
but 82
from 2
every 10
window 12
there 21
were 5
beauties 1
to 805
be 1200
seen 1
the 193
rooms 1
were 5
lofty 1
and 51
handsome 6
and 51
their 2
furniture 2
suitable 3
to 805
the 193
fortune 8
of 109
its 2
proprietor 7
but 82
elizabeth 5
saw 24
with 34
admiration 2
of 109
his 43
taste 15
that 11
it 67
was 93
neither 1
gaudy 1
nor 102
uselessly 1
fine 17
with 34
less 19
of 109
and 51
more 11
real 47
elegance 2
than 22
the 193
furniture 2
of 109
and 51
of 109
this 6
place 29
thought 11
she 199
i 4330
might 9
have 11
been 1
mistress 3
with 34
these 4
rooms 1
i 4330
might 9
now 10
have 11
been 1
familiarly 1
acquainted 1
instead 1
of 109
viewing 3
them 9
as 509
a 6799
stranger 3
i 4330
might 9
have 11
rejoiced 1
in 2719
them 9
as 509
my 90
own 9
and 51
welcomed 1
to 805
them 9
as 509
visitors 1
my 90
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
but 82
no 896
recollecting 1
herself 1
that 11
could 2
never 3
be 1200
my 90
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
would 5
have 11
been 1
lost 1
to 805
me 1041
i 4330
should 7
not 85
have 11
been 1
allowed 1
to 805
invite 7
them 9
this 6
was 93
a 6799
lucky 1
recollection 3
it 67
saved 1
her 181
from 2
something 3
very 1
like 22
regret 9
she 199
longed 1
to 805
inquire 6
of 109
the 193
housekeeper 3
whether 1
her 181
master 28
was 93
really 1
absent 14
but 82
had 11
not 85
the 193
courage 6
for 484
it 67
at 272
length 14
however 1
the 193
question 16
was 93
asked 1
by 57
her 181
uncle 18
and 51
she 199
turned 1
away 1
with 34
alarm 9
while 4
mrs 1
reynolds 1
replied 1
that 11
he 962
was 93
adding 1
but 82
we 444
expect 20
him 9
to 805
morrow 3
with 34
a 6799
large 11
party 3
of 109
friends 4
how 27
rejoiced 1
was 93
elizabeth 5
that 11
their 2
own 9
journey 11
had 11
not 85
by 57
any 17
circumstance 4
been 1
delayed 1
a 6799
day 27
her 181
aunt 6
now 10
called 1
her 181
to 805
look 14
at 272
a 6799
picture 8
she 199
approached 1
and 51
saw 24
the 193
likeness 3
of 109
mr 5
suspended 1
several 3
other 5
miniatures 1
over 596
the 193
mantelpiece 3
her 181
aunt 6
asked 1
her 181
smilingly 1
how 27
she 199
liked 1
it 67
the 193
housekeeper 3
came 36
forward 12
and 51
told 1
them 9
it 67
was 93
a 6799
picture 8
of 109
a 6799
young 9
gentleman 3
the 193
son 70
of 109
her 181
late 23
master's 1
steward 10
who 79
had 11
been 1
brought 1
up 194
by 57
him 9
at 272
his 43
own 9
expense 3
he 962
is 124
now 10
gone 4
into 26
the 193
army 2
she 199
added 1
but 82
i 4330
am 392
afraid 1
he 962
has 41
turned 1
out 365
very 1
wild 36
mrs 1
looked 1
at 272
her 181
niece 3
with 34
a 6799
smile 7
but 82
elizabeth 5
could 2
not 85
return 14
it 67
and 51
that 11
said 1
mrs 1
reynolds 1
pointing 1
to 805
another 1
of 109
the 193
miniatures 1
is 124
my 90
master 28
and 51
very 1
like 22
him 9
it 67
was 93
drawn 1
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45
as 509
the 193
other 5
about 1
eight 18
years 1
ago 15
i 4330
have 11
heard 1
much 2
of 109
your 4
master's 1
fine 17
person 33
said 1
mrs 1
looking 1
at 272
the 193
picture 8
it 67
is 124
a 6799
handsome 6
face 19
but 82
lizzy 2
you 29
can 287
tell 16
us 70
whether 1
it 67
is 124
like 22
or 333
not 85
mrs 1
reynolds 1
respect 18
for 484
elizabeth 5
seemed 1
to 805
increase 4
on 86
this 6
intimation 3
of 109
her 181
knowing 3
her 181
master 28
does 5
that 11
young 9
lady 18
know 12
mr 5
darcy 2
elizabeth 5
and 51
said 1
a 6799
little 6
and 51
do 814
not 85
you 29
think 8
him 9
a 6799
very 1
handsome 6
gentleman 3
ma'am 1

very 1
handsome 6
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
i 4330

none 32
so 797
handsome 6
but 82
in 2719
the 193
gallery 2
up 194
stairs 1
you 29
will 39
see 70
a 6799
finer 3
larger 1
picture 8
of 109
him 9
than 22
this 6
this 6
room 22
was 93
my 90
late 23
master's 1
room 22
and 51
these 4
miniatures 1
are 12
just 24
as 509
they 5
used 1
to 805
be 1200
then 5
he 962
was 93
very 1
fond 17
of 109
them 9
this 6
accounted 1
to 805
elizabeth 5
for 484
mr 5
being 3
among 1
them 9
mrs 1
reynolds 1
then 5
directed 1
their 2
attention 3
to 805
one 19
of 109
miss 71
darcy 2
drawn 1
when 6
she 199
was 93
only 1
eight 18
years 1
old 21
and 51
is 124
miss 71
darcy 2
as 509
handsome 6
as 509
her 181
brother 9
said 1
mrs 1
oh 17
yes 16
the 193
handsomest 1
young 9
lady 18
that 11
ever 33
was 93
seen 1
and 51
so 797
accomplished 1
she 199
plays 5
and 51
sings 6
all 162
day 27
long 49
in 2719

a 6799
new 115
instrument 16

a 6799
present 20
from 2
my 90
master 28

here 31
to 805
morrow 3
with 34
him 9
mr 5
whose 1
manners 1
were 5
very 1
easy 2
and 51
pleasant 9
encouraged 1
her 181
by 57
his 43
questions 1
and 51
remarks 1
mrs 1
reynolds 1
either 1
by 57
pride 6
or 333
attachment 3
had 11
evidently 1
great 12
pleasure 5
in 2719
talking 1
of 109
her 181
master 28
and 51
his 43
sister 9
is 124
your 4
master 28
much 2
at 272
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
the 193
year 19
not 85
so 797
much 2
as 509
i 4330
could 2
wish 13
sir 22
but 82
i 4330
dare 15
say 7
he 962
may 49
spend 11
half 23
his 43
time 45
here 31
and 51
miss 71
darcy 2
is 124
always 1
down 90
for 484
the 193
summer 13
months 1
except 10
thought 11
elizabeth 5
when 6
she 199
goes 1
to 805
if 8
your 4
master 28
would 5
marry 2
you 29
might 9
see 70
more 11
of 109
him 9
yes 16
sir 22
but 82
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
when 6
that 11
will 39
be 1200
i 4330
do 814
not 85
know 12
who 79
is 124
good 28
enough 2
for 484
him 9
mr 5
and 51
mrs 1
smiled 1
elizabeth 5
could 2
not 85
help 23
saying 3
it 67
is 124
very 1
much 2
to 805
his 43
credit 12
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
that 11
you 29
should 7
think 8
so 797
i 4330
say 7
no 896
more 11
than 22
the 193
truth 7
and 51
everybody 2
will 39
say 7
that 11
knows 1
him 9
replied 1
the 193
other 5
elizabeth 5
thought 11
this 6
was 93
going 3
pretty 3
far 91
and 51
she 199
listened 1
with 34
increasing 2
astonishment 2
as 509
the 193
housekeeper 3
added 1
i 4330
have 11
never 3
known 1
a 6799
cross 74
word 26
from 2
him 9
in 2719
my 90
life 44
and 51
i 4330
have 11
known 1
him 9
ever 33
since 7
he 962
was 93
four 26
years 1
old 21
this 6
was 93
praise 7
of 109
all 162
others 1
most 3
extraordinary 1
most 3
opposite 4
to 805
her 181
ideas 1
that 11
he 962
was 93
not 85
a 6799
good 28
tempered 1
man 342
had 11
been 1
her 181
firmest 1
opinion 4
her 181
keenest 1
attention 3
was 93
awakened 1
she 199
longed 1
to 805
hear 76
more 11
and 51
was 93
grateful 4
to 805
her 181
uncle 18
for 484
saying 3
there 21
are 12
very 1
few 6
people 4
of 109
whom 3
so 797
much 2
can 287
be 1200
said 1
you 29
are 12
lucky 1
in 2719
having 1
such 2
a 6799
master 28
yes 16
sir 22
i 4330
know 12
i 4330
am 392
if 8
i 4330
were 5
to 805
go 500
through 4
the 193
world 12
i 4330
could 2
not 85
meet 9
with 34
a 6799
better 7
but 82
i 4330
have 11
always 1
observed 1
that 11
they 5
who 79
are 12
good 28
when 6
children 1
are 12
good 28
when 6
they 5
grow 21
up 194
and 51
he 962
was 93
always 1
the 193
sweetest 1
tempered 1
most 3
generous 4
boy 25
in 2719
the 193
world 12
elizabeth 5
almost 1
stared 1
at 272
her 181
can 287
this 6
be 1200
mr 5
darcy 2
thought 11
she 199
his 43
father 12
was 93
an 970
excellent 2
man 342
said 1
mrs 1
yes 16
ma'am 1
that 11
he 962
was 93
indeed 1
and 51
his 43
son 70
will 39
be 1200
just 24
like 22
him 9
just 24
as 509
affable 1
to 805
the 193
poor 11
elizabeth 5
listened 1
wondered 1
doubted 1
and 51
was 93
impatient 2
for 484
more 11
mrs 1
reynolds 1
could 2
interest 6
her 181
on 86
no 896
other 5
point 22
she 199
related 3
the 193
subjects 1
of 109
the 193
pictures 5
the 193
dimensions 1
of 109
the 193
rooms 1
and 51
the 193
price 6
of 109
the 193
furniture 2
in 2719
vain 8
mr 5
highly 1
amused 1
by 57
the 193
kind 31
of 109
family 2
prejudice 4
to 805
which 2
he 962
attributed 1
her 181
excessive 2
commendation 3
of 109
her 181
master 28
soon 3
led 11
again 2
to 805
the 193
subject 11
and 51
she 199
dwelt 1
with 34
energy 2
on 86
his 43
many 2
merits 1
as 509
they 5
proceeded 1
together 3
up 194
the 193
great 12
staircase 3
he 962
is 124
the 193
best 37
landlord 3
and 51
the 193
best 37
master 28
said 1
she 199
that 11
ever 33
lived 1
not 85
like 22
the 193
wild 36
young 9
men 140
nowadays 2
who 79
think 8
of 109
nothing 5
but 82
themselves 1
there 21
is 124
not 85
one 19
of 109
his 43
tenants 1
or 333
servants 1
but 82
will 39
give 15
him 9
a 6799
good 28
name 17
some 30
people 4
call 57
him 9
proud 5
but 82
i 4330
am 392
sure 11
i 4330
never 3
saw 24
anything 3
of 109
it 67
to 805
my 90
fancy 5
it 67
is 124
only 1
because 1
he 962
does 5
not 85
rattle 17
away 1
like 22
other 5
young 9
men 140
in 2719
what 14
an 970
amiable 1
light 42
does 5
this 6
place 29
him 9
thought 11
elizabeth 5
this 6
fine 17
account 14
of 109
him 9
whispered 1
her 181
aunt 6
as 509
they 5
walked 1
is 124
not 85
quite 1
consistent 2
with 34
his 43
to 805
our 3
poor 11
friend 14
perhaps 1
we 444
might 9
be 1200
deceived 1
that 11
is 124
not 85
very 1
likely 1
our 3
authority 2
was 93
too 50
good 28
on 86
reaching 1
the 193
spacious 4
lobby 6
above 3
they 5
were 5
shown 1
into 26
a 6799
very 1
pretty 3
sitting 3
room 22
lately 1
fitted 1
up 194
with 34
greater 1
elegance 2
and 51
lightness 2
than 22
the 193
apartments 1
below 1
and 51
were 5
informed 1
that 11
it 67
was 93
but 82
just 24
done 3
to 805
give 15
pleasure 5
to 805
miss 71
darcy 2
who 79
had 11
taken 1
a 6799
liking 2
to 805
the 193
room 22
when 6
last 7
at 272
he 962
is 124
certainly 1
a 6799
good 28
brother 9
said 1
elizabeth 5
as 509
she 199
walked 1
towards 1
one 19
of 109
the 193
windows 4
mrs 1
reynolds 1
anticipated 1
miss 71
darcy's 1
delight 8
when 6
she 199
should 7
enter 23
the 193
room 22
and 51
this 6
is 124
always 1
the 193
way 27
with 34
him 9
she 199
added 1
whatever 1
can 287
give 15
his 43
sister 9
any 17
pleasure 5
is 124
sure 11
to 805
be 1200
done 3
in 2719
a 6799
moment 14
there 21
is 124
nothing 5
he 962
would 5
not 85
do 814
for 484
her 181
the 193
picture 8
gallery 2
and 51
two 14
or 333
three 12
of 109
the 193
principal 7
bedrooms 1
were 5
all 162
that 11
remained 1
to 805
be 1200
shown 1
in 2719
the 193
former 3
were 5
many 2
good 28
paintings 1
but 82
elizabeth 5
knew 1
nothing 5
of 109
the 193
art 104
and 51
from 2
such 2
as 509
had 11
been 1
already 1
visible 1
below 1
she 199
had 11
willingly 1
turned 1
to 805
look 14
at 272
some 30
drawings 1
of 109
miss 71
darcy's 1
in 2719
crayons 1
whose 1
subjects 1
were 5
usually 1
more 11
interesting 2
and 51
also 3
more 11
intelligible 1
in 2719
the 193
gallery 2
there 21
were 5
many 2
family 2
portraits 1
but 82
they 5
could 2
have 11
little 6
to 805
fix 27
the 193
attention 3
of 109
a 6799
stranger 3
elizabeth 5
walked 1
in 2719
quest 21
of 109
the 193
only 1
face 19
whose 1
features 1
would 5
be 1200
known 1
to 805
her 181
at 272
last 7
it 67
arrested 1
her 181
and 51
she 199
beheld 1
a 6799
striking 3
resemblance 3
to 805
mr 5
darcy 2
with 34
such 2
a 6799
smile 7
over 596
the 193
face 19
as 509
she 199
remembered 1
to 805
have 11
sometimes 1
seen 1
when 6
he 962
looked 1
at 272
her 181
she 199
stood 1
several 3
minutes 2
before 2
the 193
picture 8
in 2719
earnest 8
contemplation 2
and 51
returned 1
to 805
it 67
again 2
before 2
they 5
the 193
gallery 2
mrs 1
reynolds 1
informed 1
them 9
that 11
it 67
had 11
been 1
taken 1
in 2719
his 43
father's 1
lifetime 3
there 21
was 93
certainly 1
at 272
this 6
moment 14
in 2719
elizabeth's 1
mind 25
a 6799
more 11
gentle 18
sensation 14
towards 1
the 193
original 6
than 22
she 199
had 11
ever 33
felt 5
at 272
the 193
height 7
of 109
their 2
acquaintance 5
the 193
commendation 3
bestowed 1
on 86
him 9
by 57
mrs 1
reynolds 1
was 93
of 109
no 896
trifling 1
nature 3
what 14
praise 7
is 124
more 11
valuable 3
than 22
the 193
praise 7
of 109
an 970
intelligent 4
servant 3
as 509
a 6799
brother 9
a 6799
landlord 3
a 6799
master 28
she 199
considered 1
how 27
many 2
people's 1
happiness 2
were 5
in 2719
his 43
guardianship 2
how 27
much 2
of 109
pleasure 5
or 333
pain 42
was 93
it 67
in 2719
his 43
power 19
to 805
bestow 7
how 27
much 2
of 109
good 28
or 333
evil 15
must 28
be 1200
done 3
by 57
him 9
every 10
idea 21
that 11
had 11
been 1
brought 1
forward 12
by 57
the 193
housekeeper 3
was 93
to 805
his 43
character 16
and 51
as 509
she 199
stood 1
before 2
the 193
canvas 16
on 86
which 2
he 962
was 93
represented 1
and 51
fixed 2
his 43
eyes 8
upon 1
herself 1
she 199
thought 11
of 109
his 43
regard 7
with 34
a 6799
deeper 1
sentiment 18
of 109
gratitude 2
than 22
it 67
had 11
ever 33
raised 1
before 2
she 199
remembered 1
its 2
warmth 2
and 51
softened 1
its 2
impropriety 2
of 109
expression 11
when 6
all 162
of 109
the 193
house 87
that 11
was 93
open 21
to 805
general 22
inspection 3
had 11
been 1
seen 1
they 5
returned 1
downstairs 2
and 51
taking 4
leave 14
of 109
the 193
housekeeper 3
were 5
consigned 1
over 596
to 805
the 193
gardener 3
who 79
met 180
them 9
at 272
the 193
hall 45
door 41
as 509
they 5
walked 1
across 1
the 193
hall 45
towards 1
the 193
river 17
elizabeth 5
turned 1
back 182
to 805
look 14
again 2
her 181
uncle 18
and 51
aunt 6
stopped 1
also 3
and 51
while 4
the 193
former 3
was 93
conjecturing 1
as 509
to 805
the 193
date 15
of 109
the 193
building 3
the 193
owner 5
of 109
it 67
himself 1
suddenly 1
came 36
forward 12
from 2
the 193
road 38
which 2
led 11
behind 4
it 67
to 805
the 193
stables 2
they 5
were 5
within 3
twenty 2
yards 4
of 109
each 1
other 5
and 51
so 797
abrupt 6
was 93
his 43
appearance 3
that 11
it 67
was 93
impossible 2
to 805
avoid 8
his 43
sight 17
their 2
eyes 8
instantly 1
met 180
and 51
the 193
cheeks 1
of 109
both 8
were 5
overspread 3
with 34
the 193
deepest 1
blush 8
he 962
absolutely 1
started 1
and 51
for 484
a 6799
moment 14
seemed 1
immovable 1
from 2
surprise 4
but 82
shortly 1
recovering 1
himself 1
advanced 1
towards 1
the 193
party 3
and 51
spoke 14
to 805
elizabeth 5
if 8
not 85
in 2719
terms 1
of 109
perfect 24
composure 2
at 272
least 3
of 109
perfect 24
civility 2
she 199
had 11
instinctively 1
turned 1
away 1
but 82
stopping 1
on 86
his 43
approach 6
received 1
his 43
compliments 1
with 34
an 970
embarrassment 3
impossible 2
to 805
be 1200
overcome 2
had 11
his 43
first 8
appearance 3
or 333
his 43
resemblance 3
to 805
the 193
picture 8
they 5
had 11
just 24
been 1
examining 1
been 1
insufficient 2
to 805
assure 6
the 193
other 5
two 14
that 11
they 5
now 10
saw 24
mr 5
darcy 2
the 193
gardener's 1
expression 11
of 109
surprise 4
on 86
beholding 1
his 43
master 28
must 28
immediately 1
have 11
told 1
it 67
they 5
stood 1
a 6799
little 6
aloof 4
while 4
he 962
was 93
talking 1
to 805
their 2
niece 3
who 79
astonished 1
and 51
confused 2
scarcely 1
dared 6
lift 11
her 181
eyes 8
to 805
his 43
face 19
and 51
knew 1
not 85
what 14
answer 8
she 199
returned 1
to 805
his 43
civil 15
inquiries 1
after 48
her 181
family 2
amazed 1
at 272
the 193
alteration 3
of 109
his 43
manner 8
since 7
they 5
last 7
parted 1
every 10
sentence 4
that 11
he 962
uttered 1
was 93
increasing 2
her 181
embarrassment 3
and 51
every 10
idea 21
of 109
the 193
impropriety 2
of 109
her 181
being 3
found 18
there 21
recurring 1
to 805
her 181
mind 25
the 193
few 6
minutes 2
in 2719
which 2
they 5
continued 1
were 5
some 30
of 109
the 193
most 3
uncomfortable 1
in 2719
her 181
life 44
nor 102
did 23
he 962
seem 10
much 2
more 11
at 272
ease 10
when 6
he 962
spoke 14
his 43
accent 14
had 11
none 32
of 109
its 2
usual 3
sedateness 2
and 51
he 962
repeated 2
his 43
inquiries 1
as 509
to 805
the 193
time 45
of 109
her 181
having 1
left 19
and 51
of 109
her 181
having 1
stayed 1
in 2719
so 797
often 4
and 51
in 2719
so 797
hurried 2
a 6799
way 27
as 509
plainly 1
spoke 14
the 193
distraction 3
of 109
his 43
thoughts 1
at 272
length 14
every 10
idea 21
seemed 1
to 805
fail 12
him 9
and 51
after 48
standing 3
a 6799
few 6
moments 1
without 1
saying 3
a 6799
word 26
he 962
suddenly 1
recollected 1
himself 1
and 51
took 1
leave 14
the 193
others 1
then 5
joined 1
her 181
and 51
expressed 1
admiration 2
of 109
his 43
figure 7
but 82
elizabeth 5
heard 1
not 85
a 6799
word 26
and 51
wholly 1
engrossed 1
by 57
her 181
own 9
feelings 1
followed 1
them 9
in 2719
silence 7
she 199
was 93
overpowered 1
by 57
shame 14
and 51
vexation 3
her 181
coming 3
there 21
was 93
the 193
most 3
unfortunate 4
the 193
most 3
ill 84
judged 1
thing 15
in 2719
the 193
world 12
how 27
strange 8
it 67
must 28
appear 7
to 805
him 9
in 2719
what 14
a 6799
disgraceful 4
light 42
might 9
it 67
not 85
strike 14
so 797
vain 8
a 6799
man 342
it 67
might 9
seem 10
as 509
if 8
she 199
had 11
purposely 1
thrown 1
herself 1
in 2719
his 43
way 27
again 2
oh 17
why 4
did 23
she 199
come 36
or 333
why 4
did 23
he 962
thus 1
come 36
a 6799
day 27
before 2
he 962
was 93
expected 1
had 11
they 5
been 1
only 1
ten 151
minutes 2
sooner 1
they 5
should 7
have 11
been 1
beyond 1
the 193
reach 6
of 109
his 43
discrimination 2
for 484
it 67
was 93
plain 27
that 11
he 962
was 93
that 11
moment 14
arrived 1
that 11
moment 14
alighted 1
from 2
his 43
horse 52
or 333
his 43
carriage 5
she 199
blushed 1
again 2
and 51
again 2
over 596
the 193
perverseness 2
of 109
the 193
meeting 6
and 51
his 43
so 797
strikingly 1
altered 1
what 14
could 2
it 67
mean 36
that 11
he 962
should 7
even 36
speak 12
to 805
her 181
was 93
amazing 2
but 82
to 805
speak 12
with 34
such 2
civility 2
to 805
inquire 6
after 48
her 181
family 2
never 3
in 2719
her 181
